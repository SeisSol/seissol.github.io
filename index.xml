The Unexpected Physics Behind Turkey’s Devastating 2023 Earthquakes The pair of major earthquakes in Turkey, 2023, ended up as one of the deadliest disasters in the region in historic times. The earthquake sequence was unusual because the two earthquakes were almost of the same size (called a “doublet”), which compounded the damage.</description></item><item><title>Segment-Jumping Ridgecrest Earthquakes Explored in New Study</title><link>http://seissol.github.io/post/ridgecrest-study/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 May 2023 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://seissol.github.io/post/ridgecrest-study/</guid><description>Segment-Jumping Ridgecrest Earthquakes Explored in New Study Seismologists use supercomputer to reveal complex dynamics of multi-fault earthquake systems.

In 2022, 13 student teams again take part in a 48-hour live contest to compute HPC workloads on their compute clusters. While participants could prepare for most of the SCC applications over the summer, the Mystery Application is only revealed when the cluster competition has started.
We&amp;rsquo;re proud to introduce SeisSol as this year&amp;rsquo;s Mystery Application.</description></item><item><title>Years-Long Collaboration Helps Geophysicists Better Understand Severe Earthquake-Tsunami Risks</title><link>http://seissol.github.io/post/collaboration_gcs2022/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://seissol.github.io/post/collaboration_gcs2022/</guid><description>The Gauss Centre for Supercomputing featured an article about the successful LMU+TUM collaboration on SeisSol - read the full article here: https://www.gauss-centre.eu/news/research-highlights/years-long-collaboration-helps-geophysicists-better-understand-severe-earthquake-tsunami-risks/</description></item><item><title>Paper on 3D Acoustic-Elastic Coupling with Gravity Accepted for SC21 Conference</title><link>http://seissol.github.io/post/seissol-sc21/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 15:40:57 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://seissol.github.io/post/seissol-sc21/</guid><description>As part of the ChEESE project, we realised a Pilot Demonstrator for simulating tsunami-earthquake interaction.
