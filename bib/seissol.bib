    abstract={We present a dynamic rupture model of the 2016 Mw 7.8 Kaik{\={o}}ura earthquake to unravel the event's riddles in a physics-based manner and provide insight on the mechanical viability of competing hypotheses proposed to explain them. Our model reproduces key characteristics of the event and constraints puzzling features inferred from high-quality observations including a large gap separating surface rupture traces, the possibility of significant slip on the subduction interface, the non-rupture of the Hope fault, and slow apparent rupture speed. We show that the observed rupture cascade is dynamically consistent with regional stress estimates and a crustal fault network geometry inferred from seismic and geodetic data. We propose that the complex fault system operates at low apparent friction thanks to the combined effects of overpressurized fluids, low dynamic friction and stress concentrations induced by deep fault creep.},

    abstract = "{The dynamics and potential size of earthquakes depend crucially on rupture transfers between adjacent fault segments. To accurately describe earthquake source dynamics, numerical models can account for realistic fault geometries and rheologies such as nonlinear inelastic processes off the slip interface. We present implementation, verification and application of off-fault Drucker–Prager plasticity in the open source software SeisSol (www.seissol.org). SeisSol is based on an arbitrary high-order derivative modal Discontinuous Galerkin method using unstructured, tetrahedral meshes specifically suited for complex geometries. Two implementation approaches are detailed, modelling plastic failure either employing subelemental quadrature points or switching to nodal basis coefficients. At fine fault discretizations, the nodal basis approach is up to six times more efficient in terms of computational costs while yielding comparable accuracy. Both methods are verified in community benchmark problems and by 3-D numerical h- and p-refinement studies with heterogeneous initial stresses. We observe no spectral convergence for on-fault quantities with respect to a given reference solution, but rather discuss a limitation to low-order convergence for heterogeneous 3-D dynamic rupture problems. For simulations including plasticity, a high fault resolution may be less crucial than commonly assumed, due to the regularization of peak slip rate and an increase of the minimum cohesive zone width. In large-scale dynamic rupture simulations based on the 1992 Landers earthquake, we observe high rupture complexity including reverse slip, direct branching and dynamic triggering. The spatiotemporal distribution of rupture transfers are altered distinctively by plastic energy absorption, correlated with locations of geometrical fault complexity. Computational cost increases by 7 per cent when accounting for off-fault plasticity in the demonstrating application. Our results imply that the combination of fully 3-D dynamic modelling, complex fault geometries and off-fault plastic yielding is important to realistically capture dynamic rupture transfers in natural fault systems.}",

We combine a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with the ideas of the ADER time integration approach using Arbitrary high-order DERivatives. The time integration is performed via the so-called Cauchy-Kovalewski procedure using repeatedly the governing partial differential equation itself. In contrast to classical finite element methods we allow for discontinuities of the piecewise polynomial approximation of the solution at element interfaces. This way, we can use the well-established theory of fluxes across element interfaces based on the solution of Riemann problems as developed in the finite volume framework. In particular, we replace time derivatives in the Taylor expansion of the time integration procedure by space derivatives to obtain a numerical scheme of the same high order in space and time using only one single explicit step to evolve the solution from one time level to another. The method is specially suited for linear hyperbolic systems such as the heterogeneous elastic wave equations and allows an efficient implementation. We consider continuous sources in space and time and point sources characterized by a Delta distribution in space and some continuous source time function. Hereby, the method is able to deal with point sources at any position in the computational domain that does not necessarily need to coincide with a mesh point. Interpolation is automatically performed by evaluation of test functions at the source locations. The convergence analysis demonstrates that very high accuracy is retained even on strongly irregular meshes and by increasing the order of the ADER–DG schemes computational time and storage space can be reduced remarkably. Applications of the proposed method to Lamb's Problem, a problem of strong material heterogeneities and to an example of global seismic wave propagation finally confirm its accuracy, robustness and high flexibility.},

    abstract = {We present a new numerical method to solve the heterogeneous elastic wave equations formulated as a linear hyperbolic system using first-order derivatives with arbitrary high-order accuracy in space and time on 3-D unstructured tetrahedral meshes. The method combines the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) Finite Element (FE) method with the ADER approach using Arbitrary high-order DERivatives for flux calculation. In the DG framework, in contrast to classical FE methods, the numerical solution is approximated by piecewise polynomials which allow for discontinuities at element interfaces. Therefore, the well-established theory of numerical fluxes across element interfaces obtained by the solution of Riemann-Problems can be applied as in the finite volume framework. To define a suitable flux over the element surfaces, we solve so-called Generalized Riemann-Problems (GRP) at the element interfaces. The GRP solution provides simultaneously a numerical flux function as well as a time-integration method. The main idea is a Taylor expansion in time in which all time-derivatives are replaced by space derivatives using the so-called Cauchy–Kovalewski or Lax–Wendroff procedure which makes extensive use of the governing PDE. The numerical solution can thus be advanced for one time step without intermediate stages as typical, for example, for classical Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes. Due to the ADER time-integration technique, the same approximation order in space and time is achieved automatically. Furthermore, the projection of the tetrahedral elements in physical space on to a canonical reference tetrahedron allows for an efficient implementation, as many computations of 3-D integrals can be carried out analytically beforehand. Based on a numerical convergence analysis, we demonstrate that the new schemes provide very high order accuracy even on unstructured tetrahedral meshes and computational cost and storage space for a desired accuracy can be reduced by higher-order schemes. Moreover, due to the choice of the basis functions for the piecewise polynomial approximation, the new ADER–DG method shows spectral convergence on tetrahedral meshes. An application of the new method to a well-acknowledged test case and comparisons with analytical and reference solutions, obtained by different well-established methods, confirm the performance of the proposed method. Therefore, the development of the highly accurate ADER–DG approach for tetrahedral meshes provides a numerical technique to approach 3-D wave propagation problems in complex geometry with unforeseen accuracy.},

As error norm we choose the time–frequency representation of the envelope and phase misfit of seismograms to assess the accuracy of the resulting seismograms since this provides the time evolution of the spectral content and allows for the clear separation of amplitude and phase errors obtained by the numerical method.

The ADER-DG method uses triangles as computational cells which simplifies the process of discretization of very complex surfaces and volumes by using external automated tools. Discontinuous Galerkin methods are well suited for solving dynamic rupture problems in the velocity-stress formulation as the variables are naturally discontinuous at the interface between two elements. Therefore, the fault has to be honored by the computational mesh. The so-called Riemann problem can be solved to obtain well defined values of the variables at the discontinuity itself. Fault geometries of high complexity can be modeled thanks to the flexibility of unstructured meshes, which solves a major bottleneck of other high-order numerical methods. Additionally, element refinement and coarsening are easily controlled in the meshing process to better resolve the near-fault area of the model. The fundamental properties of the method are shown, as well as a series of validating exercises with reference solutions and a comparison with the well-established finite difference, boundary integral, and spectral element methods, in order to test the accuracy of our formulation. An example of dynamic rupture on a nonplanar fault based upon the Landers 1992 earthquake fault system is presented to illustrate the main potentials of the new method.},

abstract = {Accurate and efficient numerical methods to simulate dynamic earthquake rupture and wave propagation in complex media and complex fault geometries are needed to address fundamental questions in earthquake dynamics, to integrate seismic and geodetic data into emerging approaches for dynamic source inversion, and to generate realistic physics-based earthquake scenarios for hazard assessment. Modeling of spontaneous earthquake rupture and seismic wave propagation by a high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method combined with an arbitrarily high-order derivatives (ADER) time integration method was introduced in two dimensions by de la Puente et al. (2009). The ADER-DG method enables high accuracy in space and time and discretization by unstructured meshes. Here we extend this method to three-dimensional dynamic rupture problems. The high geometrical flexibility provided by the usage of tetrahedral elements and the lack of spurious mesh reflections in the ADER-DG method allows the refinement of the mesh close to the fault to model the rupture dynamics adequately while concentrating computational resources only where needed. Moreover, ADER-DG does not generate spurious high-frequency perturbations on the fault and hence does not require artificial Kelvin-Voigt damping. We verify our three-dimensional implementation by comparing results of the SCEC TPV3 test problem with two well-established numerical methods, finite differences, and spectral boundary integral. Furthermore, a convergence study is presented to demonstrate the systematic consistency of the method. To illustrate the capabilities of the high-order accurate ADER-DG scheme on unstructured meshes, we simulate an earthquake scenario, inspired by the 1992 Landers earthquake, that includes curved faults, fault branches, and surface topography.},

abstract = {Abstract The nonlinear mechanical responses of rocks and soils to seismic waves play an important role in earthquake physics, influencing ground motion from source to site. Continuous geophysical monitoring, such as ambient noise interferometry, has revealed co-seismic wave speed reductions extending tens of kilometers from earthquake sources. However, the mechanisms governing these changes remain challenging to model, especially at regional scales. Using a nonlinear damage model constrained by laboratory experiments, we develop and apply an open-source 3D discontinuous Galerkin method to simulate regional co-seismic wave speed changes during the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake. We find pronounced spatial variations of co-seismic wave speed reduction, ranging from <0.01\% to >50\%, particularly close to the source and within the Kathmandu Basin, while disagreement with observations remains. The most significant reduction occurs within the sedimentary basin and varies with basin depths, whereas wave speed reductions correlate with the fault slip distribution near the source. By comparing ground motions from simulations with elastic, viscoelastic, elastoplastic, and nonlinear damage rheologies, we demonstrate that the nonlinear damage model effectively captures low-frequency ground motion amplification due to strain-dependent wave speed reductions in soft sediments. We verify the accuracy of our approach through comparisons with analytical solutions and assess its scalability on high-performance computing systems. The model shows near-linear strong and weak scaling up to 2,048 nodes, enabling efficient large-scale simulations. Our findings provide a physics-based framework to quantify nonlinear earthquake effects and emphasize the importance of damage-induced wave speed variations for seismic hazard assessment and ground motion predictions.},

Using the velocity–stress formulation provides a linear hyperbolic system of equations with source terms that is completed by additional equations for the anelastic functions including the strain history of the material. These additional equations result from the rheological model of the generalized Maxwell body and permit the incorporation of realistic attenuation properties of viscoelastic material accounting for the behaviour of elastic solids and viscous fluids. The proposed method combines the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element (FE) method with the ADER approach using Arbitrary high order DERivatives for flux calculations. The DG approach, in contrast to classical FE methods, uses a piecewise polynomial approximation of the numerical solution which allows for discontinuities at element interfaces. Therefore, the well-established theory of numerical fluxes across element interfaces obtained by the solution of Riemann problems can be applied as in the finite volume framework. The main idea of the ADER time integration approach is a Taylor expansion in time in which all time derivatives are replaced by space derivatives using the so-called Cauchy—Kovalewski procedure which makes extensive use of the governing PDE. Due to the ADER time integration technique the same approximation order in space and time is achieved automatically and the method is a one-step scheme advancing the solution for one time step without intermediate stages. To this end, we introduce a new unrolled recursive algorithm for efficiently computing the Cauchy–Kovalewski procedure by making use of the sparsity of the system matrices. The numerical convergence analysis demonstrates that the new schemes provide very high order accuracy even on unstructured tetrahedral meshes while computational cost and storage space for a desired accuracy can be reduced when applying higher degree approximation polynomials. In addition, we investigate the increase in computing time, when the number of relaxation mechanisms due to the generalized Maxwell body are increased. An application to a well-acknowledged test case and comparisons with analytic and reference solutions, obtained by different well-established numerical methods, confirm the performance of the proposed method. Therefore, the development of the highly accurate ADER—DG approach for tetrahedral meshes including viscoelastic material provides a novel, flexible and efficient numerical technique to approach 3-D wave propagation problems including realistic attenuation and complex geometry.},

Using the most general Hooke's tensor we derive the velocity-stress formulation leading to a linear hyperbolic system which accounts for the variation of the material properties depending on direction. This approach allows for the accurate modelling even of the most general crystalline symmetry class, the triclinic anisotropy, as no interpolation of material properties to particular mesh vertices is necessary. The proposed method combines the Discontinuous Galerkin method with the arbitrary high-order derivatives (ADER) time integration approach using arbitrary high-order derivatives of the piecewise polynomial representation of the unknown solution.

Due to the novel ADER time integration technique the scheme provides the same approximation order in space and time automatically. A numerical convergence study confirms that the new scheme achieves the desired arbitrary high-order accuracy even for anisotropic material on unstructured tetrahedral meshes. Furthermore, it shows that higher accuracy can be reached with higher-order schemes while reducing computational cost and storage space. To this end, we also present a new Godunov-type numerical flux for anisotropic material and compare its accuracy with a computationally simpler Rusanov flux. As a further extension, we include the coupling of anisotropy and viscoelastic attenuation based on the Generalized Maxwell Body rheology and the mean and deviatoric stress concepts. Finally, we validate the new scheme by comparing the results of our simulations to an analytic solution as well as to spectral element computations.},

,abstract = { We have developed a new numerical method to solve the heterogeneous poroelastic wave equations in bounded three-dimensional domains. This method is a discontinuous Galerkin method that achieves arbitrary high-order accuracy on unstructured tetrahedral meshes for the low-frequency range and the inviscid case. By using Biot’s equations and Darcy’s dynamic laws, we have built a scheme that can successfully model wave propagation in fluid-saturated porous media when anisotropy of the pore structure is allowed. Zero-inflow fluxes are used as absorbing boundary conditions. A continuous arbitrary high-order derivatives time integration is used for the high-frequency inviscid case, whereas a space-time discontinuous scheme is applied for the low-frequency case. We conducted a numerical convergence test of the proposed methods. We used a series of examples to quantify the quality of our numerical results, comparing them to analytic solutions as well as numerical solutions obtained by other methodologies. In particular, a large scale 3D reservoir model showed the method’s suitability to solve poroelastic wave-propagation problems for complex geometries using unstructured tetrahedral meshes. The resulting method is proved to be high-order accurate in space and time, stable for the low-frequency case, and asymptotically consistent with the diffusion limit. }

abstract = {Many applications from the fields of seismology and geoengineering require simulations of seismic waves in porous media. Biot's theory of poroelasticity describes the coupling between solid and fluid phases and introduces a stiff reactive source term (Darcy's Law) into the elastodynamic wave equations, thereby increasing computational cost of respective numerical solvers and motivating efficient methods utilising High-Performance Computing. We present a novel realisation of the discontinuous Galerkin scheme with Arbitrary High-Order DERivative time stepping (ADER-DG) that copes with stiff source terms. To integrate this source term with a reasonable time step size, we utilise an element-local space-time predictor, which needs to solve medium-sized linear systems – each with 1,000 to 10,000 unknowns – in each element update (i.e., billions of times). We present a novel block-wise back-substitution algorithm for solving these systems efficiently, thus enabling large-scale 3D simulations. In comparison to LU decomposition, we reduce the number of floating-point operations by a factor of up to 25, when using polynomials of degree 6. The block-wise back-substitution is mapped to a sequence of small matrix-matrix multiplications, for which code generators are available to generate highly optimised code. We verify the new solver thoroughly against analytical and semi-analytical reference solutions in problems of increasing complexity. We demonstrate high-order convergence of the scheme for 3D problems. We verify the correct treatment of point sources and boundary conditions, including homogeneous and heterogeneous full space problems as well as problems with traction-free boundary conditions. In addition, we compare against a finite difference solution for a newly defined 3D layer over half-space problem containing an internal material interface and free surface. We find that extremely high accuracy is required to accurately resolve the slow, diffusive P-wave at a or near a free surface, while we also demonstrate that solid particle velocities are not affected by coarser resolutions. We demonstrate that by using a clustered local time stepping scheme, time to solution is reduced by a factor of 6 to 10 compared to global time stepping. We conclude our study with a scaling and performance analysis on the SuperMUC-NG supercomputer, demonstrating our implementation's high computational efficiency and its potential for extreme-scale simulations.}

    abstract = {Numerical simulations of earthquakes and seismic wave propagation require accurate material models of the solid Earth. In contrast to purely elastic rheology, poroelasticity accounts for pore fluid pressure and fluid flow in porous media. Poroelastic effects can alter both the seismic wave field and the dynamic rupture characteristics of earthquakes. For example, the presence of fluids may affect cascading multifault ruptures, potentially leading to larger-than-expected earthquakes. However, incorporating poroelastic coupling into the elastodynamic wave equations increases the computational complexity of numerical simulations compared to elastic or viscoelastic material models, as the underlying partial differential equations become stiff. In this study, we use a Discontinuous Galerkin solver with Arbitrary High-Order DERivative time stepping of the poroelastic wave equations implemented in the open-source software SeisSol to simulate 3-D complex seismic wave propagation and 3-D dynamic rupture in poroelastic media. We verify our approach for double-couple point sources using independent methods including a semi-analytical solution and a finite-difference scheme and a homogeneous full-space and a poroelastic layer-over-half-space model, respectively. In a realistic carbon capture and storage reservoir scenario at the Sleipner site in the Utsira Formation, Norway, we model 3-D wave propagation through poroelastic sandstone layers separated by impermeable shale. Our results show a sudden change in the pressure field across material interfaces, which manifests as a discontinuity when viewed at the length scale of the dominant wavelengths of S or fast P waves. Accurately resolving the resulting steep pressure gradient dramatically increases the computational demands, requiring high-resolution modelling. We show that the Gassmann elastic equivalent model yields almost identical results to the fully poroelastic model when focusing solely on solid particle velocities. We extend this approach using suitable numerical fluxes to 3-D dynamic rupture simulations in complex fault systems, presenting the first 3-D scenarios that combine poroelastic media with geometrically complex, multifault rupture dynamics and tetrahedral meshes. Our findings reveal that, in contrast to modelling wave propagation only, poroelastic materials significantly alter rupture characteristics compared to using elastic equivalent media since the elastic equivalent fails to capture the evolution of pore pressure. Particularly in fault branching scenarios, the Biot coefficient plays a key role in either promoting or inhibiting fault activation. In some cases, ruptures are diverted to secondary faults, while in others, poroelastic effects induce rupture arrest. In a fault zone dynamic rupture model, we find poroelasticity aiding pulse-like rupture. A healing front is induced by the reduced pore pressure due to reflected waves from the boundaries of the poroelastic damage zone. Our results highlight that poroelastic effects are important for realistic simulations of seismic waves and earthquake rupture dynamics. In particular, our poroelastic simulations may offer new insights on the complexity of multifault rupture dynamics, fault-to-fault interaction and seismic wave propagation in realistic models of the Earth’s subsurface.},

We introduce a new code generator (“ChainForge”) that fuses subsequent batched matrix multiplications (“GEMMs”) into a single GPU kernel, holding intermediate results in shared memory as long as necessary. The generator operates as an external module linked against SeisSol's domain specific language YATeTo and, as a result, the original SeisSol source code remains mainly unchanged. In this paper, we discuss several challenges related to automatic fusion of GPU kernels and provide solutions to them. By and large, we gain \$\$ \approx \$\$60\% in performance of SeisSol's wave propagation solver using Fused-GEMMs compared to the original GPU implementation. We demonstrated this on benchmarks as well as on a real production scenario simulating the Northridge 1994 earthquake.},

abstract = {The numerical solution of partial differential equations is at the heart of many grand challenges in supercomputing. Solvers based on high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretisation have been shown to scale on large supercomputers with excellent performance and efficiency if the implementation exploits all levels of parallelism and is tailored to the specific architecture. However, every year new supercomputers emerge and the list of hardware-specific considerations grows simultaneously with the list of desired features in a DG code. Thus, we believe that a sustainable DG code needs an abstraction layer to implement the numerical scheme in a suitable language. We explore the possibility to abstract the numerical scheme as small tensor operations, describe them in a domain-specific language (DSL) resembling the Einstein notation, and to map them to small General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication routines. The compiler for our DSL implements classic optimisations that are used for large tensor contractions, and we present novel optimisation techniques such as equivalent sparsity patterns and optimal index permutations for temporary tensors. Our application examples, which include the earthquake simulation software SeisSol, show that the generated kernels achieve over 50\% peak performance of a recent 48-core Skylake system while the DSL considerably simplifies the implementation.},

With hierarchical methods like Multilevel Delayed Acceptance (MLDA) drastically reducing compute cost, sampling Bayesian posteriors for computationally intensive models becomes increasingly feasible. Pushing MLDA towards the strong scaling regime (i.e. high compute resources, short time-to-solution) remains a challenge: Even though MLDA only requires a moderate number of high-accuracy simulation runs, it inherits the sequential chain structure and need for chain burn-in from Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).We present fully asynchronous parallel prefetching for MLDA, adding an axis of scalability complementary to forward model parallelization and parallel chains. A thorough scaling analysis demonstrates that prefetching is advantageous in strong scaling scenarios. We investigate the behavior of prefetching MLDA in small-scale test problems. A large-scale geophysics application, namely parameter identification for non-linear earthquake modelling, highlights interaction with coarse-level quality and model scalability.},

abstract={Megathrust faults host the largest earthquakes on Earth, which can trigger cascading hazards such as devastating tsunamis. Determining characteristics that control subduction-zone earthquake and tsunami dynamics is critical to mitigate megathrust hazards but is impeded by structural complexity, large spatio-temporal scales and scarce or asymmetric instrumental coverage. Here we use high-performance computing multi-physics simulations to show that tsunami genesis and earthquake dynamics are controlled by along-arc variability in regional tectonic stresses together with depth-dependent variations in rigidity and yield strength of near-fault sediments. We aim to identify dominant regional factors controlling megathrust hazards. To this end, we demonstrate how to unify and verify the required initial conditions for geometrically complex, multi-physics earthquake--tsunami modelling from interdisciplinary geophysical observations. We present large-scale computational models of the 2004 Sumatra--Andaman earthquake and Indian Ocean tsunami that reconcile near- and far-field seismic, geodetic, geological, and tsunami observations and reveal tsunamigenic trade-offs between slip to the trench, splay faulting and bulk yielding of the accretionary wedge. Our computational capabilities render possible the incorporation of present and emerging high-resolution observations into dynamic-rupture-tsunami models and will be applicable to other large megathrust earthquakes. Our findings highlight the importance of regional-scale structural heterogeneity to decipher megathrust hazards.},

As pre-earthquake Pf magnitude increases, effective normal stress and fault shear strength decrease. As a result, magnitude, slip, peak slip rate, stress drop, and rupture velocity of the scenario earthquakes decrease. Comparison of results with observations of the 2004 earthquake support that pre-earthquake Pf averages near 97\% of lithostatic pressure, leading to pre-earthquake average shear and effective normal tractions of 4–5 and 22 MPa. The megathrust in these scenarios is weak, in terms of low mean shear traction at static failure and low dynamic friction coefficient during rupture. Apparent co-seismic principal stress rotations and absolute post-seismic stresses in these scenarios are consistent with the variety of observed aftershock focal mechanisms. In all scenarios, the mean apparent stress rotations are larger above than below the megathrust. Scenarios with larger Pf magnitudes exhibit lower mean apparent principal stress rotations. We further evaluate pre-earthquake Pf depth distribution. If Pf follows a sublithostatic gradient, pre-earthquake effective normal stress increases with depth. If Pf follows the lithostatic gradient exactly, then this normal stress is constant, shifting peak slip and peak slip rate updip. This renders constraints on near-trench strength and constitutive behavior crucial for mitigating hazard. These scenarios provide opportunity for future calibration with site-specific measurements to constrain dynamically plausible megathrust strength and Pf gradients.},

We aim to further understand the rotational ground motion and its relation to the translational wave field, with a special emphasis on the near field, a few wavelengths away from the hypocenter, where damage related to rotational motion might need to be considered. A broad picture of the available values of rotational amplitudes and their variability is obtained by gathering most of the published data on strong rotational motion. To obtain a more detailed picture we perform a large scale 3D numerical study of a strike-slip event in the Grenoble valley where a combination of topographic, source, and site effects produces a realistic wave field. We analyzed the synthetic dataset in terms of the rotational and translational peak amplitudes and their dependence on two effects: nonlinear soil behavior and source directivity. On a soft soil deposit, we observe peak ground rotation of 1 mrad and the peak ground rotation rate of 10 mrad/sec, for an Mw 6.0 event. Those values show a strong dependence on the hypocenter location, the local site conditions, and the topographical features, inducing a variability of almost one order of magnitude in a range of distances of 20 km. Finally, we compare our numerical results in terms of peak ground velocity (PGV) versus peak ground rotation (PGω) with field data obtained at similar scenarios (e.g., Parkfield) by array techniques to investigate the relation between translational and rotational amplitudes expected in the near field for shallow, medium-sized earthquakes. Results of our numerical simulation fit reasonably well with those observed in past studies. Furthermore, the spatial variations of the PGV/PGω ratio show a trend, which is correlated with the velocity structure of the model under study.},

abstract = {The 2016 Central Italy earthquake sequence is characterized by remarkable rupture complexity, including highly heterogeneous slip across multiple faults in an extensional tectonic regime. The dense coverage and high quality of geodetic and seismic data allow us to image intriguing details of the rupture kinematics of the largest earthquake of the sequence, the Mw 6.5 October 30th, 2016 Norcia earthquake, such as an energetically weak nucleation phase. Several kinematic models suggest multiple fault planes rupturing simultaneously, however, the mechanical viability of such models is not guaranteed. Using 3D dynamic rupture and seismic wave propagation simulations accounting for two fault planes, we constrain “families” of spontaneous dynamic models informed by a high-resolution kinematic rupture model of the earthquake. These families differ in their parameterization of initial heterogeneous shear stress and strength in the framework of linear slip weakening friction. First, we dynamically validate the kinematically inferred two-fault geometry and rake inferences with models based on only depth-dependent stress and constant friction coefficients. Then, more complex models with spatially heterogeneous dynamic parameters allow us to retrieve slip distributions similar to the target kinematic model and yield good agreement with seismic and geodetic observations. We discuss the consistency of the assumed constant or heterogeneous static and dynamic friction coefficients with mechanical properties of rocks at 3-10 km depth characterizing the Italian Central Apennines and their local geological and lithological implications. We suggest that suites of well-fitting dynamic rupture models belonging to the same family generally exist and can be derived by exploiting the trade-offs between dynamic parameters. Our approach will be applicable to validate the viability of kinematic models and classify spontaneous dynamic rupture scenarios that match seismic and geodetic observations as well as geological constraints.}

abstract = {Abstract Seismic faults are surrounded by damaged rocks with reduced rigidity and enhanced attenuation. These damaged fault zone structures can amplify seismic waves and affect earthquake dynamics, yet they are typically omitted in physics-based regional ground motion simulations. We report on the significant effects of a shallow, flower-shaped fault zone in foreshock-mainshock 3D dynamic rupture models of the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence. We find that the fault zone structure both amplifies and reduces ground motions not only locally but at distances exceeding 100 km. This impact on ground motions is frequency- and magnitude-dependent, particularly affecting higher frequency ground motions from the foreshock because its corner frequency is closer to the fault zone's fundamental eigenfrequency. Within the fault zone, the shallow transition to a velocity-strengthening frictional regime leads to a depth-dependent peak slip rate increase of up to 70\% and confines fault zone-induced supershear transitions mostly to the fault zone's velocity-weakening roots. However, the interplay of fault zone waves, free surface reflections, and rupture directivity can generate localized supershear rupture, even in narrow velocity-strengthening regions, which are typically thought to inhibit supershear rupture. This study demonstrates that shallow fault zone structures may significantly affect intermediate- and far-field ground motions and cause localized supershear rupture penetrating into velocity-strengthening regions, with important implications for seismic hazard assessment.},

    abstract = {Fault zones exhibit geometrical complexity and are often surrounded by multiscale fracture networks within their damage zones, potentially influencing rupture dynamics and near‐field ground motions. In this study, we investigate the ground‐motion characteristics of cascading ruptures across damage zone fracture networks of moderate‐size earthquakes (Mw 5.5–6.0) using high‐resolution 3D dynamic rupture simulations. Our models feature a listric normal fault surrounded by more than 800 fractures, emulating a major fault and its associated damage zone. We analyze three cases: a cascading rupture propagating within the fracture network (Mw 5.5), a non‐cascading main‐fault rupture with off‐fault fracture slip (Mw 6.0), and a main‐fault rupture without a fracture network (Mw 6.0). Cascading ruptures within the fracture network produce distinct ground‐motion signatures with enriched high‐frequency content, arising from simultaneous slip of multiple fractures and parts of the main fault, resembling source coda‐wave‐like signatures. This case shows elevated near‐field characteristic frequency (fc) and stress drop, approximately an order of magnitude higher than the estimation directly on the fault of the dynamic rupture simulation. The inferred fc of the modeled vertical ground‐motion components reflects the complexity of the radiation pattern and rupture directivity of fracture‐network cascading earthquakes. We show that this is consistent with observations of strong azimuthal dependence of corner frequency in the 2009–2016 central Apennines, Italy, earthquake, sequence. Simulated ground motions from fracture‐network cascading ruptures also show pronounced azimuthal variations in peak ground acceleration (PGA), peak ground velocity, and pseudospectral acceleration, with average PGA nearly double that of the non‐cascading cases. Cascading ruptures radiate high‐frequency seismic energy, yield nontypical ground‐motion characteristics including coda‐wave‐like signatures, and may result in a significantly higher seismologically inferred stress drop and PGA. Such outcomes emphasize the critical role of fault‐zone complexity in affecting rupture dynamics and seismic radiation and have important implications for physics‐based seismic hazard assessment.},

We perform fully 3D dynamic rupture simulations caused by fluid injection on a target fault for Fault Activation and Earthquake Ruptures experiments generating Mw ≤ 1 earthquakes. We investigate the dynamics of rupture propagation with spatially variable stress drop caused by pore pressure changes and assuming different slip-weakening constitutive parameters. We show that the spontaneous arrest of propagating ruptures is possible by assuming a high fault strength parameter S, that is, a high ratio between strength excess and dynamic stress drop. In faults with high S values (low rupturing potential), even minor variations in Dc (from 0.45 to 0.6 mm) have a substantial effect on the rupture propagation and the ultimate earthquake size. Modest spatial variations of dynamic stress drop determine the rupture mode, distinguishing self-arresting from run-away ruptures. Our results suggest that several characteristics inferred for accelerating dynamic ruptures differ from those observed during rupture deceleration of a self-arresting earthquake. During deceleration, a decrease of peak slip velocity is associated with a nearly constant cohesive zone size. Moreover, the residual slip velocity value (asymptotic value for a crack-like rupture) decreases to nearly zero. This means that an initially crack-like rupture becomes a pulse-like rupture during spontaneous arrest. These findings highlight the complex dynamics of small induced earthquakes, which differ from solutions obtained from conventional crack-like models of earthquake rupture.},

    abstract = {Elastodynamic Green’s functions are an essential ingredient in seismology as they form the connection between direct observations of seismic waves and the earthquake source. They are also fundamental to various seismological techniques including physics-based ground motion prediction and kinematic or dynamic source inversions. In regions with established 3-D models of the Earth’s elastic structure, such as southern California, 3-D Green’s functions can be computed using numerical simulations of seismic wave propagation. However, such simulations are computationally expensive, which poses challenges for real-time ground motion prediction and uncertainty quantification in source inversions. In this study, we address these challenges by using a reduced-order model (ROM) approach that enables the rapid evaluation of approximate Green’s functions. The ROM technique developed approximates three-component time-dependent surface velocity wavefields obtained from numerical simulations of seismic wave propagation. We apply our ROM approach to a 50 km \$\\times\$ 40 km area in greater Los Angeles accounting for topography, site effects, 3-D subsurface velocity structure, and viscoelastic attenuation. The ROM constructed for this region enables rapid computation (\$\\approx 0.0001\$ CPU hr) of complete, high-resolution (500 m spacing), 0.5 Hz surface velocity wavefields that are accurate for a shortest wavelength of 1.0 km for a single elementary moment tensor source. Using leave-one-out cross validation, we measure the accuracy of our Green’s functions for the CVM-S velocity model in both the time domain and frequency domain. Averaged across all sources, receivers, and time steps, the error in the rapid seismograms is less than 0.01 cm s−1. We demonstrate that the ROM can accurately and rapidly reproduce simulated seismograms for generalized moment tensor sources in our region, as well as kinematic sources by using a finite fault model of the 1987 \$M\_\\mathrm\{ W\}\$ 5.9 Whittier Narrows earthquake as an example. We envision that rapid, accurate Green’s functions from reduced-order modelling for complex 3-D seismic wave propagation simulations will be useful for constructing real-time ground motion synthetics and source inversions with high spatial resolution.},

Such pulses were identified during the Mw 7.8 and Mw 7.5 earthquake doublet of the 2023 Turkey seismic sequence, potentially contributing to the extensive damage it caused. Therefore, a better understanding and characterization of pulse properties (e.g. period and amplitude) and their underlying physical factors are crucial for earthquake-resistant design. In this study, we characterize the velocity pulses reported in observed records and synthetic waveforms generated by a three-dimensional (3D) dynamic rupture simulation of the Mw 7.8 event. We observed significant variability in the pulse properties of the observed records in near-fault regions, particularly regarding their orientations. This variability was not fully captured by the dynamic rupture simulation. Our results indicate that directivity effects are not the only factors influencing pulse characteristics in this earthquake doublet. While site effects (e.g. basin effects) may influence pulse characteristics at some stations, local heterogeneities in slip amplitude, orientations, and fault geometries can be critical in generating or influencing pulse properties in this earthquake doublet. }

Despite the large number of observed earthquakes, the scaling of the earthquake energy budget remains enigmatic. We propose that fundamentally different fracture processes govern small and large earthquakes. We combined seismological observations with physics-based earthquake models, finding that both dynamic weakening and restrengthening effects are non-negligible in the energy budget of small earthquakes. We established a linear scaling relationship between fracture energy and fault size and a break in scaling with slip. We applied this scaling using supercomputing and unveiled large dynamic rupture earthquake cascades involving \&gt;700 multiscale fractures within a fault damage zone. We provide a simple explanation for seismicity across all scales with implications for comprehending earthquake genesis and multifault rupture cascades. Earthquakes vary in size, with the largest and most complex also being the most dangerous. The challenge is trying to figure out whether the information gleaned from smaller events can simply be scaled up to understand larger events. Gabriel et al. combined seismic observations with physics-based earthquake models to determine the differences. Their results outline conditions for when multiple-fault, complex ruptures occur and show that fundamentally different fracture processes govern both large and small earthquakes. —Brent Grocholski}

abstract = {Abstract The Mediterranean Hellenic Arc subduction zone (HASZ) has generated several \${\mathrm{M}}\_{W}\ge \$8 earthquakes and tsunamis. Seismic-probabilistic tsunami hazard assessment typically utilizes uniform or stochastic earthquake models, which may not represent dynamic rupture and tsunami generation complexity. We present an ensemble of ten 3D dynamic rupture earthquake scenarios for the HASZ, utilizing a realistic slab geometry. Our simplest models use uniform along-arc pre-stresses or a single circular initial stress asperity. We then introduce progressively more complex models varying initial shear stress along-arc, multiple asperities based on scale-dependent critical slip weakening distance, and a most complex model blending all aforementioned heterogeneities. Thereby, regional initial conditions are constrained without relying on detailed geodetic locking models. Varying epicentral locations in the simplest, homogeneous model leads to different rupture speeds and moment magnitudes. We observe dynamic fault slip penetrating the shallow slip-strengthening region and affecting seafloor uplift. Off-fault plastic deformation can double vertical seafloor uplift. A single-asperity model generates a \${\mathrm{M}}\_{W}\sim \$8 scenario resembling the 1303 Crete earthquake. Using along-strike varying initial stresses results in \${\mathrm{M}}\_{W}\sim \$8.0–8.5 dynamic rupture scenarios with diverse slip rates and uplift patterns. The model with the most heterogeneous initial conditions yields a \${\mathrm{M}}\_{W}\sim \$7.5 scenario. Dynamic rupture complexity in prestress and fracture energy tends to lower earthquake magnitude but enhances tsunamigenic displacements. Our results offer insights into the dynamics of potential large Hellenic Arc megathrust earthquakes and may inform future physics-based joint seismic and tsunami hazard assessments.},

    abstract = {Seismic arrays constrain local wave propagation that can be used to infer earthquake source characteristics. Array processing is routinely used to infer detailed earthquake properties of intermediate and large events. However, the source properties of microseismicity often remain elusive. In this study, we use high signal‐to‐noise ratio seismograms of 204 ML 0.0–1.8 earthquakes induced by the 6 km deep 2018 Espoo/Helsinki geothermal stimulation to evaluate the performance and capabilities of beamforming and backprojection array methods. Using accurate travel‐time‐based event locations as a reference, we first show that miniarray beamforming is sensitive to medium heterogeneities and requires calibration to mitigate local systematic slowness biases. A catalog‐based calibration significantly improves our multiarray beam raytracing estimates of source locations. Second, the application of the backprojection technique using P‐wave signals with sufficient azimuthal coverage yields hypocenter estimates with generally good horizontal but poor vertical resolution. The short local source–receiver distances result in incomplete separation of P‐ and S‐wave arrivals during backprojection. Numerical tests show that the relatively large S‐wave amplitudes can influence coherent P‐wave stacks, resulting in large location errors. Our combined P‐ and S‐wave backprojection approach mitigates the influence of the large S‐wave amplitude and improves the depth resolution significantly. The average depth offset to the reference catalog locations reduces from ≥1.4 km to ∼91 m. Third, 3D numerical simulations demonstrate that backprojection swimming patterns are not merely processing or configuration artifacts. We show that the swimming patterns correlate with and can resolve the source focal mechanism when the azimuthal wavefield sampling is sufficiently complete. Our work demonstrates that the backprojection techniques can help to better constrain important properties of local‐scale microseismicity.},

abstract = {Abstract Slow slip events (SSEs) have been observed in spatial and temporal proximity to megathrust earthquakes in various subduction zones, including the 2014 Mw 7.3 Guerrero, Mexico earthquake which was preceded by a Mw 7.6 SSE. However, the underlying physics connecting SSEs to earthquakes remains elusive. Here, we link 3D slow-slip cycle models with dynamic rupture simulations across the geometrically complex flat-slab Cocos plate boundary. Our physics-based models reproduce key regional geodetic and teleseismic fault slip observations on timescales from decades to seconds. We find that accelerating SSE fronts transiently increase shear stress at the down-dip end of the seismogenic zone, modulated by the complex geometry beneath the Guerrero segment. The shear stresses cast by the migrating fronts of the 2014 Mw 7.6 SSE are significantly larger than those during the three previous episodic SSEs that occurred along the same portion of the megathrust. We show that the SSE transient stresses are large enough to nucleate earthquake dynamic rupture and affect rupture dynamics. However, additional frictional asperities in the seismogenic part of the megathrust are required to explain the observed complexities in the coseismic energy release and static surface displacements of the Guerrero earthquake. We conclude that it is crucial to jointly analyze the long- and short-term interactions and complexities of SSEs and megathrust earthquakes across several (a)seismic cycles accounting for megathrust geometry. Our study has important implications for identifying earthquake precursors and understanding the link between transient and sudden megathrust faulting processes.},

We investigate 10 distinct orientations of maximum horizontal stress, probing the conditions necessary for sustained slip within the fracture network or activating the main fault. Additionally, we assess the feasibility of nucleating dynamic rupture earthquake cascades from a distant fracture and investigate the sensitivity of fracture network cascading rupture to the effective normal stress level. We model either pure cascades or main fault rupture with limited off-fault slip. We find that cascading ruptures within the fracture network are dynamically feasible under certain conditions, including: (a) the fracture energy scales with fracture and fault size, (b) favorable relative pre-stress of fractures within the ambient stress field, and (c) close proximity of fractures. We find that cascading rupture within the fracture network discourages rupture on the main fault. Our simulations suggest that fractures with favorable relative pre-stress, embedded within a fault damage zone, may lead to cascading earthquake rupture that shadows main fault slip. We find that such off-fault events may reach moment magnitudes up to Mw ≈ 5.5, comparable to magnitudes that can be otherwise hosted by the main fault.

abstract = {The destructive 2023 moment magnitude (Mw) 7.8-7.7 earthquake doublet ruptured multiple segments of the East Anatolian Fault system in Turkey. We integrated multiscale seismic and space-geodetic observations with multifault kinematic inversions and dynamic rupture modeling to unravel the events’ complex rupture history and stress-mediated fault interactions. Our analysis reveals three subshear slip episodes during the initial Mw 7.8 earthquake with a delayed rupture initiation to the southwest. The Mw 7.7 event occurred 9 hours later with a larger slip and supershear rupture on its western branch. Mechanically consistent dynamic models accounting for fault interactions can explain the unexpected rupture paths and require a heterogeneous background stress. Our results highlight the importance of combining near- and far-field observations with data-driven and physics-based models for seismic hazard assessment. The Kahramanmaraş earthquake sequence in Turkey on 6 February 2023 caused a tremendous amount of damage and loss of life. The sequence occurred across several faults, including and associated with the East Anatolian Fault, a strike-slip fault that has had many major earthquakes in the past. Jia et al. used an array of geophysical observations to produce models of how the ruptures occurred. The earthquake sequence ruptured at least six faults, including a large portion of the East Anatolian Fault. The rupture sequence was complex and contained surprises in the details of how the rupture occurred. These observations and models are important for understanding strike-slip faults and forecasting seismic hazards. —Brent Grocholski The Kahramanmaraş earthquake sequence was a complex set of ruptures that resulted in a large amount of damage and casualties.}}

abstract={The observational difficulties and the complexity of earthquake physics have rendered seismic hazard assessment largely empirical. Despite increasingly high-quality geodetic, seismic and field observations, data-driven earthquake imaging yields stark differences and physics-based models explaining all observed dynamic complexities are elusive. Here we present data-assimilated three-dimensional dynamic rupture models of California's biggest earthquakes in more than 20{\thinspace}years: the moment magnitude (Mw) 6.4 Searles Valley and Mw{\thinspace}7.1 Ridgecrest sequence, which ruptured multiple segments of a non-vertical quasi-orthogonal conjugate fault system1. Our models use supercomputing to find the link between the two earthquakes. We explain strong-motion, teleseismic, field mapping, high-rate global positioning system and space geodetic datasets with earthquake physics. We find that regional structure, ambient long- and short-term stress, and dynamic and static fault system interactions driven by overpressurized fluids and low dynamic friction are conjointly crucial to understand the dynamics and delays of the sequence. We demonstrate that a joint physics-based and data-driven approach can be used to determine the mechanics of complex fault systems and earthquake sequences when reconciling dense earthquake recordings, three-dimensional regional structure and stress models. We foresee that physics-based interpretation of big observational datasets will have a transformative impact on future geohazard mitigation.},

    abstract = {Dynamic rupture simulations generate synthetic waveforms that account for nonlinear source and path complexity. Here, we analyze millions of spatially dense waveforms from 3D dynamic rupture simulations in a novel way to illuminate the spectral fingerprints of earthquake physics. We define a Brune‐type equivalent near‐field corner frequency (fc) to analyze the spatial variability of ground‐motion spectra and unravel their link to source complexity. We first investigate a simple 3D strike‐slip setup, including an asperity and a barrier, and illustrate basic relations between source properties and fc variations. Next, we analyze \&gt;13,000,000 synthetic near‐field strong‐motion waveforms generated in three high‐resolution dynamic rupture simulations of real earthquakes, the 2019 Mw 7.1 Ridgecrest mainshock, the Mw 6.4 Searles Valley foreshock, and the 1992 Mw 7.3 Landers earthquake. All scenarios consider 3D fault geometries, topography, off‐fault plasticity, viscoelastic attenuation, and 3D velocity structure and resolve frequencies up to 1–2 Hz. Our analysis reveals pronounced and localized patterns of elevated fc, specifically in the vertical components. We validate such fc variability with observed near‐fault spectra. Using isochrone analysis, we identify the complex dynamic mechanisms that explain rays of elevated fc and cause unexpectedly impulsive, localized, vertical ground motions. Although the high vertical frequencies are also associated with path effects, rupture directivity, and coalescence of multiple rupture fronts, we show that they are dominantly caused by rake‐rotated surface‐breaking rupture fronts that decelerate due to fault heterogeneities or geometric complexity. Our findings highlight the potential of spatially dense ground‐motion observations to further our understanding of earthquake physics directly from near‐field data. Observed near‐field fc variability may inform on directivity, surface rupture, and slip segmentation. Physics‐based models can identify “what to look for,” for example, in the potentially vast amount of near‐field large array or distributed acoustic sensing data.},

abstract = {Abstract Physics-based simulations of earthquake ground motion are useful to complement recorded ground motions. However, the computational expense of performing numerical simulations hinders their applicability to tasks that require real-time solutions or ensembles of solutions for different earthquake sources. To enable rapid physics-based solutions, we present a reduced-order modeling approach based on interpolated proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to predict peak ground velocities (PGVs). As a demonstrator, we consider PGVs from regional 3D wave propagation simulations at the location of the 2008 MW 5.4 Chino Hills earthquake using double-couple sources with varying depth and focal mechanisms. These simulations resolve frequencies ≤1.0 Hz and include topography, viscoelastic attenuation, and S-wave speeds ≥500 m/s. We evaluate the accuracy of the interpolated POD reduced-order model (ROM) as a function of the approximation method. Comparing the radial basis function (RBF), multilayer perceptron neural network, random forest, and k-nearest neighbor, we find that the RBF interpolation gives the lowest error (≈0.1 cm/s) when tested against an independent data set. We also find that evaluating the ROM is 107–108 times faster than the wave propagation simulations. We use the ROM to generate PGV maps for 1 million different focal mechanisms, in which we identify potentially damaging ground motions and quantify correlations between focal mechanism, depth, and accuracy of the predicted PGV. Our results demonstrate that the ROM can rapidly and accurately approximate the PGV from wave propagation simulations with variable source properties, topography, and complex subsurface structure.},

    abstract = {Seismic waves can couple with the atmosphere and generate sound waves. The influence of faulting mechanisms on earthquake sound patterns provides opportunities for earthquake source characterization. Sound radiated from earthquakes can be perceived as disturbing, even at low ground‐shaking levels, which can negatively impact the social acceptance of geoengineering applications. Motivated by consistent reports of felt and heard disturbances associated with the weeks‐long stimulation of a 6‐km‐deep geothermal system in 2018 below the Otaniemi district of Espoo, Helsinki, we conduct fully coupled 3D numerical simulations of wave propagation in the solid Earth and the atmosphere. We assess the sensitivity of the ground shaking and audible noise distributions to the source geometry of the induced earthquakes based on the properties of the largest local magnitude ML 1.8 event. Utilizing recent computational advances and the open‐source software SeisSol, we model seismoacoustic frequencies up to 25 Hz, thereby reaching the lower limit of the human audible sound frequency range. We present synthetic distributions of shaking and audible sounds at the 50–100 m scale across a 12 km × 12 km area and discuss implications for better understanding seismic nuisances in metropolitan regions. In five 3D coupled elastic–acoustic scenario simulations that include data on topography and subsurface structure, we analyze the ground velocity and pressure levels of earthquake‐generated seismic and acoustic waves. We show that S waves generate the strongest sound disturbance with sound pressure levels ≤0.04 Pa. We use statistical analysis to compare our noise distributions with commonly used empirical relationships. We find that our 3D synthetic amplitudes are generally smaller than the empirical predictions and that the interaction of the source mechanism‐specific radiation pattern and topography can lead to significant nonlinear effects. Our study highlights the complexity and information content of spatially variable audible effects associated with small induced earthquakes on local scales.},

abstract = {Abstract The Húsavík-Flatey Fault Zone (HFFZ) is the largest strike-slip fault in Iceland and poses a high seismic risk to coastal communities. To investigate physics-based constraints on earthquake hazards, we construct three fault system models of varying geometric complexity and model 79 3-D multi-fault dynamic rupture scenarios in the HFFZ. By assuming a simple regional prestress and varying hypocenter locations, we analyze the rupture dynamics, fault interactions, and the associated ground motions up to 2.5 Hz. All models account for regional seismotectonics, topo-bathymetry, 3-D subsurface velocity, viscoelastic attenuation, and off-fault plasticity, and we explore the effect of fault roughness. The rupture scenarios obey earthquake scaling relations and predict magnitudes comparable to those of historical events. We show how fault system geometry and segmentation, hypocenter location, and prestress can affect the potential for rupture cascading, leading to varying slip distributions across different portions of the fault system. Our earthquake scenarios yield spatially heterogeneous near-field ground motions modulated by geometric complexities, topography, and rupture directivity, particularly in the near-field. The average ground motion attenuation characteristics of dynamic rupture scenarios of comparable magnitudes and mean stress drop are independent of variations in source complexity, magnitude-consistent and in good agreement with the latest regional empirical ground motion models. However, physics-based ground motion variability changes considerably with fault-distance and increases for unilateral compared to bilateral ruptures. Systematic variations in physics-based near-fault ground motions provide important insights into the mechanics and potential earthquake hazard of large strike-slip fault systems, such as the HFFZ.},

    abstract = {Frictional heating during earthquake rupture raises the fault‐zone fluid pressure, which affects dynamic rupture and seismic radiation. Here, we investigate two key parameters governing thermal pressurization of pore fluids – hydraulic diffusivity and shear‐zone half‐width – and their effects on earthquake rupture dynamics, kinematic source properties, and ground motions. We conduct 3D strike‐slip dynamic rupture simulations assuming a rate‐and‐state dependent friction law with strong velocity weakening coupled to thermal‐pressurization of pore fluids. Dynamic rupture evolution and ground shaking are densely evaluated across the fault and Earth’s surface to analyze the variations of rupture parameters (slip, peak slip rate, rupture speed, and rise time), correlations among rupture parameters, and variability of peak ground velocity. Our simulations reveal how variations in thermal‐pressurization affect earthquake rupture properties. We find that the mean slip and rise time decrease with increasing hydraulic diffusivity, whereas mean rupture speed and peak slip‐rate remain almost constant. Mean slip, peak slip‐rate, and rupture speed decrease with increasing shear‐zone half‐width, whereas mean rise time increases. Shear‐zone half‐width distinctly affects the correlation between rupture parameters, especially for parameter pairs (slip, rupture speed), (peak slip‐rate, rupture speed), and (rupture speed, rise time). Hydraulic diffusivity has negligible effects on these correlations. Variations in shear‐zone half‐width primarily impact rupture speed, which then may affect other rupture parameters. We find a negative correlation between slip and peak slip‐rate, unlike simpler dynamic rupture models. Mean peak ground velocities decrease faster with increasing shear‐zone half‐width than with increasing hydraulic diffusivity, whereas ground‐motion variability is similarly affected by both the parameters. Our results show that shear‐zone half‐width affects rupture dynamics, kinematic rupture properties, and ground shaking more strongly than hydraulic diffusivity. We interpret the importance of shear‐zone half‐width based on the characteristic time of diffusion. Our findings may inform pseudodynamic rupture generators and guide future studies on how to account for thermal‐pressurization effects.},

    abstract = {Tsunami generation by offshore earthquakes is a problem of scientific interest and practical relevance, and one that requires numerical modelling for data interpretation and hazard assessment. Most numerical models utilize two-step methods with one-way coupling between separate earthquake and tsunami models, based on approximations that might limit the applicability and accuracy of the resulting solution. In particular, standard methods focus exclusively on tsunami wave modelling, neglecting larger amplitude ocean acoustic and seismic waves that are superimposed on tsunami waves in the source region. In this study, we compare four earthquake-tsunami modelling methods. We identify dimensionless parameters to quantitatively approximate dominant wave modes in the earthquake-tsunami source region, highlighting how the method assumptions affect the results and discuss which methods are appropriate for various applications such as interpretation of data from offshore instruments in the source region. Most methods couple a 3-D solid earth model, which provides the seismic wavefield or at least the static elastic displacements, with a 2-D depth-averaged shallow water tsunami model. Assuming the ocean is incompressible and tsunami propagation is negligible over the earthquake duration leads to the instantaneous source method, which equates the static earthquake seafloor uplift with the initial tsunami sea surface height. For longer duration earthquakes, it is appropriate to follow the time-dependent source method, which uses time-dependent earthquake seafloor velocity as a forcing term in the tsunami mass balance. Neither method captures ocean acoustic or seismic waves, motivating more advanced methods that capture the full wavefield. The superposition method of Saito et al. solves the 3-D elastic and acoustic equations to model the seismic wavefield and response of a compressible ocean without gravity. Then, changes in sea surface height from the zero-gravity solution are used as a forcing term in a separate tsunami simulation, typically run with a shallow water solver. A superposition of the earthquake and tsunami solutions provides an approximation to the complete wavefield. This method is algorithmically a two-step method. The complete wavefield is captured in the fully coupled method, which utilizes a coupled solid Earth and compressible ocean model with gravity. The fully coupled method, recently incorporated into the 3-D open-source code SeisSol, simultaneously solves earthquake rupture, seismic waves and ocean response (including gravity). We show that the superposition method emerges as an approximation to the fully coupled method subject to often well-justified assumptions. Furthermore, using the fully coupled method, we examine how the source spectrum and ocean depth influence the expression of oceanic Rayleigh waves. Understanding the range of validity of each method, as well as its computational expense, facilitates the selection of modelling methods for the accurate assessment of earthquake and tsunami hazards and the interpretation of data from offshore instruments.},

However, direct comparison to ground motion observations of a specific earthquake is challenging. We here propose a new approach to simulate data-fused broadband ground motion synthetics using 3D dynamic rupture modeling of the 2016 Mw 6.2 Amatrice, Italy earthquake. We augment a smooth, best-fitting model from Bayesian dynamic rupture source inversion of strong-motion data (<1 Hz) with fractal fault roughness, frictional heterogeneities, viscoelastic attenuation, and topography. The required consistency to match long periods allows us to quantify the role of small-scale dynamic source heterogeneities, such as the 3D roughness drag, from observational broadband seismic waveforms. We demonstrate that 3D data-constrained fully dynamic rupture synthetics show good agreement with various observed ground-motion metrics up to ∼5 Hz and are an important avenue toward non-ergodic, physics-based seismic hazard assessment.},

abstract = {Abstract We study the effects of pore fluid pressure (Pf) on the pre-earthquake, near-fault stress state, and 3-D earthquake rupture dynamics through six scenarios utilizing a structural model based on the 2004 Mw 9.1 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake. As pre-earthquake Pf magnitude increases, effective normal stress and fault shear strength decrease. As a result, magnitude, slip, peak slip rate, stress drop, and rupture velocity of the scenario earthquakes decrease. Comparison of results with observations of the 2004 earthquake support that pre-earthquake Pf averages near 97\% of lithostatic pressure, leading to pre-earthquake average shear and effective normal tractions of 4–5 and 22 MPa. The megathrust in these scenarios is weak, in terms of low mean shear traction at static failure and low dynamic friction coefficient during rupture. Apparent co-seismic principal stress rotations and absolute post-seismic stresses in these scenarios are consistent with the variety of observed aftershock focal mechanisms. In all scenarios, the mean apparent stress rotations are larger above than below the megathrust. Scenarios with larger Pf magnitudes exhibit lower mean apparent principal stress rotations. We further evaluate pre-earthquake Pf depth distribution. If Pf follows a sublithostatic gradient, pre-earthquake effective normal stress increases with depth. If Pf follows the lithostatic gradient exactly, then this normal stress is constant, shifting peak slip and peak slip rate updip. This renders constraints on near-trench strength and constitutive behavior crucial for mitigating hazard. These scenarios provide opportunity for future calibration with site-specific measurements to constrain dynamically plausible megathrust strength and Pf gradients.},

abstract = {Abstract Detailed imaging of accretionary wedges reveals splay fault networks that could pose a significant tsunami hazard. However, the dynamics of multiple splay fault activation during megathrust earthquakes and the consequent effects on tsunami generation are not well understood. We use a 2-D dynamic rupture model with complex topo-bathymetry and six curved splay fault geometries constrained from realistic tectonic loading modeled by a geodynamic seismic cycle model with consistent initial stress and strength conditions. We find that all splay faults rupture coseismically. While the largest splay fault slips due to a complex rupture branching process from the megathrust, all other splay faults are activated either top down or bottom up by dynamic stress transfer induced by trapped seismic waves. We ascribe these differences to local non-optimal fault orientations and variable along-dip strength excess. Generally, rupture on splay faults is facilitated by their favorable stress orientations and low strength excess as a result of high pore-fluid pressures. The ensuing tsunami modeled with non-linear 1-D shallow water equations consists of one high-amplitude crest related to rupture on the longest splay fault and a second broader wave packet resulting from slip on the other faults. This results in two episodes of flooding and a larger run-up distance than the single long-wavelength (300 km) tsunami sourced by the megathrust-only rupture. Since splay fault activation is determined by both variable stress and strength conditions and dynamic activation, considering both tectonic and earthquake processes is relevant for understanding tsunamigenesis.},

abstract = {Abstract Despite decades-long debate over the mechanics of low-angle normal faults (LANFs) dipping less than 30°, many questions about their strength, stress, and slip remain unresolved. Recent geologic and geophysical observations have confirmed that gently dipping detachment faults can slip at such shallow dips and host moderate-to-large earthquakes. Here, we analyze the first 3D dynamic rupture models to assess how different stress and strength conditions affect rupture characteristics of LANF earthquakes. We model observationally constrained spontaneous rupture under different loading conditions on the active Mai'iu fault in Papua New Guinea, which dips 16°–24° at the surface and accommodates ∼8 mm/yr of horizontal extension. We analyze four distinct fault-local stress scenarios: (1) Andersonian extension, as inferred in the hanging wall; (2) back-rotated principal stresses inferred paleopiezometrically from the exhumed footwall; (3) favorably rotated principal stresses well-aligned for low-angle normal-sense slip; and (4) Andersonian extension derived from depth-variable static fault friction decreasing toward the surface. Our modeling suggests that subcritically stressed detachment faults can host moderate earthquakes within purely Andersonian stress fields. Near-surface rupture is impeded by free-surface stress interactions and dynamic effects of the gently dipping geometry and frictionally stable gouges of the shallowest portion of the fault. Although favorably inclined principal stresses have been proposed for some detachments, these conditions are not necessary for seismic slip on these faults. Our results demonstrate how integrated geophysical and geologic observations can constrain dynamic rupture model parameters to develop realistic rupture scenarios of active faults that may pose significant seismic and tsunami hazards to nearby communities.},
