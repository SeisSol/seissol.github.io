    abstract={We present a dynamic rupture model of the 2016 Mw 7.8 Kaik{\={o}}ura earthquake to unravel the event's riddles in a physics-based manner and provide insight on the mechanical viability of competing hypotheses proposed to explain them. Our model reproduces key characteristics of the event and constraints puzzling features inferred from high-quality observations including a large gap separating surface rupture traces, the possibility of significant slip on the subduction interface, the non-rupture of the Hope fault, and slow apparent rupture speed. We show that the observed rupture cascade is dynamically consistent with regional stress estimates and a crustal fault network geometry inferred from seismic and geodetic data. We propose that the complex fault system operates at low apparent friction thanks to the combined effects of overpressurized fluids, low dynamic friction and stress concentrations induced by deep fault creep.},

    abstract = "{The dynamics and potential size of earthquakes depend crucially on rupture transfers between adjacent fault segments. To accurately describe earthquake source dynamics, numerical models can account for realistic fault geometries and rheologies such as nonlinear inelastic processes off the slip interface. We present implementation, verification and application of off-fault Drucker–Prager plasticity in the open source software SeisSol (www.seissol.org). SeisSol is based on an arbitrary high-order derivative modal Discontinuous Galerkin method using unstructured, tetrahedral meshes specifically suited for complex geometries. Two implementation approaches are detailed, modelling plastic failure either employing subelemental quadrature points or switching to nodal basis coefficients. At fine fault discretizations, the nodal basis approach is up to six times more efficient in terms of computational costs while yielding comparable accuracy. Both methods are verified in community benchmark problems and by 3-D numerical h- and p-refinement studies with heterogeneous initial stresses. We observe no spectral convergence for on-fault quantities with respect to a given reference solution, but rather discuss a limitation to low-order convergence for heterogeneous 3-D dynamic rupture problems. For simulations including plasticity, a high fault resolution may be less crucial than commonly assumed, due to the regularization of peak slip rate and an increase of the minimum cohesive zone width. In large-scale dynamic rupture simulations based on the 1992 Landers earthquake, we observe high rupture complexity including reverse slip, direct branching and dynamic triggering. The spatiotemporal distribution of rupture transfers are altered distinctively by plastic energy absorption, correlated with locations of geometrical fault complexity. Computational cost increases by 7 per cent when accounting for off-fault plasticity in the demonstrating application. Our results imply that the combination of fully 3-D dynamic modelling, complex fault geometries and off-fault plastic yielding is important to realistically capture dynamic rupture transfers in natural fault systems.}",

We combine a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with the ideas of the ADER time integration approach using Arbitrary high-order DERivatives. The time integration is performed via the so-called Cauchy-Kovalewski procedure using repeatedly the governing partial differential equation itself. In contrast to classical finite element methods we allow for discontinuities of the piecewise polynomial approximation of the solution at element interfaces. This way, we can use the well-established theory of fluxes across element interfaces based on the solution of Riemann problems as developed in the finite volume framework. In particular, we replace time derivatives in the Taylor expansion of the time integration procedure by space derivatives to obtain a numerical scheme of the same high order in space and time using only one single explicit step to evolve the solution from one time level to another. The method is specially suited for linear hyperbolic systems such as the heterogeneous elastic wave equations and allows an efficient implementation. We consider continuous sources in space and time and point sources characterized by a Delta distribution in space and some continuous source time function. Hereby, the method is able to deal with point sources at any position in the computational domain that does not necessarily need to coincide with a mesh point. Interpolation is automatically performed by evaluation of test functions at the source locations. The convergence analysis demonstrates that very high accuracy is retained even on strongly irregular meshes and by increasing the order of the ADER–DG schemes computational time and storage space can be reduced remarkably. Applications of the proposed method to Lamb's Problem, a problem of strong material heterogeneities and to an example of global seismic wave propagation finally confirm its accuracy, robustness and high flexibility.},

    abstract = {We present a new numerical method to solve the heterogeneous elastic wave equations formulated as a linear hyperbolic system using first-order derivatives with arbitrary high-order accuracy in space and time on 3-D unstructured tetrahedral meshes. The method combines the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) Finite Element (FE) method with the ADER approach using Arbitrary high-order DERivatives for flux calculation. In the DG framework, in contrast to classical FE methods, the numerical solution is approximated by piecewise polynomials which allow for discontinuities at element interfaces. Therefore, the well-established theory of numerical fluxes across element interfaces obtained by the solution of Riemann-Problems can be applied as in the finite volume framework. To define a suitable flux over the element surfaces, we solve so-called Generalized Riemann-Problems (GRP) at the element interfaces. The GRP solution provides simultaneously a numerical flux function as well as a time-integration method. The main idea is a Taylor expansion in time in which all time-derivatives are replaced by space derivatives using the so-called Cauchy–Kovalewski or Lax–Wendroff procedure which makes extensive use of the governing PDE. The numerical solution can thus be advanced for one time step without intermediate stages as typical, for example, for classical Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes. Due to the ADER time-integration technique, the same approximation order in space and time is achieved automatically. Furthermore, the projection of the tetrahedral elements in physical space on to a canonical reference tetrahedron allows for an efficient implementation, as many computations of 3-D integrals can be carried out analytically beforehand. Based on a numerical convergence analysis, we demonstrate that the new schemes provide very high order accuracy even on unstructured tetrahedral meshes and computational cost and storage space for a desired accuracy can be reduced by higher-order schemes. Moreover, due to the choice of the basis functions for the piecewise polynomial approximation, the new ADER–DG method shows spectral convergence on tetrahedral meshes. An application of the new method to a well-acknowledged test case and comparisons with analytical and reference solutions, obtained by different well-established methods, confirm the performance of the proposed method. Therefore, the development of the highly accurate ADER–DG approach for tetrahedral meshes provides a numerical technique to approach 3-D wave propagation problems in complex geometry with unforeseen accuracy.},

Several parameters are responsible for the accuracy of results, such as the chosen approximation order, the spatial discretization, that is, number of elements per wavelength, and the propagation distance of the waves due to numerical dispersion and dissipation. As error norm we choose the time–frequency representation of the envelope and phase misfit of seismograms to assess the accuracy of the resulting seismograms since this provides the time evolution of the spectral content and allows for the clear separation of amplitude and phase errors obtained by the numerical method. Our results can be directly used to set up the necessary modelling parameters for practical applications, such as the minimum approximation order for a given mesh spacing to reach a desired accuracy.

The ADER-DG method uses triangles as computational cells which simplifies the process of discretization of very complex surfaces and volumes by using external automated tools. Discontinuous Galerkin methods are well suited for solving dynamic rupture problems in the velocity-stress formulation as the variables are naturally discontinuous at the interface between two elements. Therefore, the fault has to be honored by the computational mesh. The so-called Riemann problem can be solved to obtain well defined values of the variables at the discontinuity itself. Fault geometries of high complexity can be modeled thanks to the flexibility of unstructured meshes, which solves a major bottleneck of other high-order numerical methods. Additionally, element refinement and coarsening are easily controlled in the meshing process to better resolve the near-fault area of the model. The fundamental properties of the method are shown, as well as a series of validating exercises with reference solutions and a comparison with the well-established finite difference, boundary integral, and spectral element methods, in order to test the accuracy of our formulation. An example of dynamic rupture on a nonplanar fault based upon the Landers 1992 earthquake fault system is presented to illustrate the main potentials of the new method.},

abstract = {Accurate and efficient numerical methods to simulate dynamic earthquake rupture and wave propagation in complex media and complex fault geometries are needed to address fundamental questions in earthquake dynamics, to integrate seismic and geodetic data into emerging approaches for dynamic source inversion, and to generate realistic physics-based earthquake scenarios for hazard assessment. Modeling of spontaneous earthquake rupture and seismic wave propagation by a high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method combined with an arbitrarily high-order derivatives (ADER) time integration method was introduced in two dimensions by de la Puente et al. (2009). The ADER-DG method enables high accuracy in space and time and discretization by unstructured meshes. Here we extend this method to three-dimensional dynamic rupture problems. The high geometrical flexibility provided by the usage of tetrahedral elements and the lack of spurious mesh reflections in the ADER-DG method allows the refinement of the mesh close to the fault to model the rupture dynamics adequately while concentrating computational resources only where needed. Moreover, ADER-DG does not generate spurious high-frequency perturbations on the fault and hence does not require artificial Kelvin-Voigt damping. We verify our three-dimensional implementation by comparing results of the SCEC TPV3 test problem with two well-established numerical methods, finite differences, and spectral boundary integral. Furthermore, a convergence study is presented to demonstrate the systematic consistency of the method. To illustrate the capabilities of the high-order accurate ADER-DG scheme on unstructured meshes, we simulate an earthquake scenario, inspired by the 1992 Landers earthquake, that includes curved faults, fault branches, and surface topography.},

abstract = {Abstract The nonlinear mechanical responses of rocks and soils to seismic waves play an important role in earthquake physics, influencing ground motion from source to site. Continuous geophysical monitoring, such as ambient noise interferometry, has revealed co-seismic wave speed reductions extending tens of kilometers from earthquake sources. However, the mechanisms governing these changes remain challenging to model, especially at regional scales. Using a nonlinear damage model constrained by laboratory experiments, we develop and apply an open-source 3D discontinuous Galerkin method to simulate regional co-seismic wave speed changes during the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake. We find pronounced spatial variations of co-seismic wave speed reduction, ranging from <0.01\% to >50\%, particularly close to the source and within the Kathmandu Basin, while disagreement with observations remains. The most significant reduction occurs within the sedimentary basin and varies with basin depths, whereas wave speed reductions correlate with the fault slip distribution near the source. By comparing ground motions from simulations with elastic, viscoelastic, elastoplastic, and nonlinear damage rheologies, we demonstrate that the nonlinear damage model effectively captures low-frequency ground motion amplification due to strain-dependent wave speed reductions in soft sediments. We verify the accuracy of our approach through comparisons with analytical solutions and assess its scalability on high-performance computing systems. The model shows near-linear strong and weak scaling up to 2,048 nodes, enabling efficient large-scale simulations. Our findings provide a physics-based framework to quantify nonlinear earthquake effects and emphasize the importance of damage-induced wave speed variations for seismic hazard assessment and ground motion predictions.},

    abstract = {We present a new numerical method to solve the heterogeneous anelastic, seismic wave equations with arbitrary high order accuracy in space and time on 3-D unstructured tetrahedral meshes. Using the velocity–stress formulation provides a linear hyperbolic system of equations with source terms that is completed by additional equations for the anelastic functions including the strain history of the material. These additional equations result from the rheological model of the generalized Maxwell body and permit the incorporation of realistic attenuation properties of viscoelastic material accounting for the behaviour of elastic solids and viscous fluids. The proposed method combines the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element (FE) method with the ADER approach using Arbitrary high order DERivatives for flux calculations. The DG approach, in contrast to classical FE methods, uses a piecewise polynomial approximation of the numerical solution which allows for discontinuities at element interfaces. Therefore, the well-established theory of numerical fluxes across element interfaces obtained by the solution of Riemann problems can be applied as in the finite volume framework. The main idea of the ADER time integration approach is a Taylor expansion in time in which all time derivatives are replaced by space derivatives using the so-called Cauchy—Kovalewski procedure which makes extensive use of the governing PDE. Due to the ADER time integration technique the same approximation order in space and time is achieved automatically and the method is a one-step scheme advancing the solution for one time step without intermediate stages. To this end, we introduce a new unrolled recursive algorithm for efficiently computing the Cauchy–Kovalewski procedure by making use of the sparsity of the system matrices. The numerical convergence analysis demonstrates that the new schemes provide very high order accuracy even on unstructured tetrahedral meshes while computational cost and storage space for a desired accuracy can be reduced when applying higher degree approximation polynomials. In addition, we investigate the increase in computing time, when the number of relaxation mechanisms due to the generalized Maxwell body are increased. An application to a well-acknowledged test case and comparisons with analytic and reference solutions, obtained by different well-established numerical methods, confirm the performance of the proposed method. Therefore, the development of the highly accurate ADER—DG approach for tetrahedral meshes including viscoelastic material provides a novel, flexible and efficient numerical technique to approach 3-D wave propagation problems including realistic attenuation and complex geometry.},

    abstract = {We present a new numerical method to solve the heterogeneous elastic anisotropic wave equation with arbitrary high-order accuracy in space and time on unstructured tetrahedral meshes. Using the most general Hooke's tensor we derive the velocity-stress formulation leading to a linear hyperbolic system which accounts for the variation of the material properties depending on direction. This approach allows for the accurate modelling even of the most general crystalline symmetry class, the triclinic anisotropy, as no interpolation of material properties to particular mesh vertices is necessary. The proposed method combines the Discontinuous Galerkin method with the arbitrary high-order derivatives (ADER) time integration approach using arbitrary high-order derivatives of the piecewise polynomial representation of the unknown solution. The discontinuities of this piecewise polynomial approximation at element interfaces permit the application of the well-established theory of finite volumes and numerical fluxes across element interfaces obtained by the solution of derivative Riemann problems. Due to the novel ADER time integration technique the scheme provides the same approximation order in space and time automatically. A numerical convergence study confirms that the new scheme achieves the desired arbitrary high-order accuracy even for anisotropic material on unstructured tetrahedral meshes. Furthermore, it shows that higher accuracy can be reached with higher-order schemes while reducing computational cost and storage space. To this end, we also present a new Godunov-type numerical flux for anisotropic material and compare its accuracy with a computationally simpler Rusanov flux. As a further extension, we include the coupling of anisotropy and viscoelastic attenuation based on the Generalized Maxwell Body rheology and the mean and deviatoric stress concepts. Finally, we validate the new scheme by comparing the results of our simulations to an analytic solution as well as to spectral element computations.},

,abstract = { We have developed a new numerical method to solve the heterogeneous poroelastic wave equations in bounded three-dimensional domains. This method is a discontinuous Galerkin method that achieves arbitrary high-order accuracy on unstructured tetrahedral meshes for the low-frequency range and the inviscid case. By using Biot’s equations and Darcy’s dynamic laws, we have built a scheme that can successfully model wave propagation in fluid-saturated porous media when anisotropy of the pore structure is allowed. Zero-inflow fluxes are used as absorbing boundary conditions. A continuous arbitrary high-order derivatives time integration is used for the high-frequency inviscid case, whereas a space-time discontinuous scheme is applied for the low-frequency case. We conducted a numerical convergence test of the proposed methods. We used a series of examples to quantify the quality of our numerical results, comparing them to analytic solutions as well as numerical solutions obtained by other methodologies. In particular, a large scale 3D reservoir model showed the method’s suitability to solve poroelastic wave-propagation problems for complex geometries using unstructured tetrahedral meshes. The resulting method is proved to be high-order accurate in space and time, stable for the low-frequency case, and asymptotically consistent with the diffusion limit. }

abstract = {Many applications from the fields of seismology and geoengineering require simulations of seismic waves in porous media. Biot's theory of poroelasticity describes the coupling between solid and fluid phases and introduces a stiff reactive source term (Darcy's Law) into the elastodynamic wave equations, thereby increasing computational cost of respective numerical solvers and motivating efficient methods utilising High-Performance Computing. We present a novel realisation of the discontinuous Galerkin scheme with Arbitrary High-Order DERivative time stepping (ADER-DG) that copes with stiff source terms. To integrate this source term with a reasonable time step size, we utilise an element-local space-time predictor, which needs to solve medium-sized linear systems – each with 1,000 to 10,000 unknowns – in each element update (i.e., billions of times). We present a novel block-wise back-substitution algorithm for solving these systems efficiently, thus enabling large-scale 3D simulations. In comparison to LU decomposition, we reduce the number of floating-point operations by a factor of up to 25, when using polynomials of degree 6. The block-wise back-substitution is mapped to a sequence of small matrix-matrix multiplications, for which code generators are available to generate highly optimised code. We verify the new solver thoroughly against analytical and semi-analytical reference solutions in problems of increasing complexity. We demonstrate high-order convergence of the scheme for 3D problems. We verify the correct treatment of point sources and boundary conditions, including homogeneous and heterogeneous full space problems as well as problems with traction-free boundary conditions. In addition, we compare against a finite difference solution for a newly defined 3D layer over half-space problem containing an internal material interface and free surface. We find that extremely high accuracy is required to accurately resolve the slow, diffusive P-wave at a or near a free surface, while we also demonstrate that solid particle velocities are not affected by coarser resolutions. We demonstrate that by using a clustered local time stepping scheme, time to solution is reduced by a factor of 6 to 10 compared to global time stepping. We conclude our study with a scaling and performance analysis on the SuperMUC-NG supercomputer, demonstrating our implementation's high computational efficiency and its potential for extreme-scale simulations.}

    abstract = {Numerical simulations of earthquakes and seismic wave propagation require accurate material models of the solid Earth. In contrast to purely elastic rheology, poroelasticity accounts for pore fluid pressure and fluid flow in porous media. Poroelastic effects can alter both the seismic wave field and the dynamic rupture characteristics of earthquakes. For example, the presence of fluids may affect cascading multifault ruptures, potentially leading to larger-than-expected earthquakes. However, incorporating poroelastic coupling into the elastodynamic wave equations increases the computational complexity of numerical simulations compared to elastic or viscoelastic material models, as the underlying partial differential equations become stiff. In this study, we use a Discontinuous Galerkin solver with Arbitrary High-Order DERivative time stepping of the poroelastic wave equations implemented in the open-source software SeisSol to simulate 3-D complex seismic wave propagation and 3-D dynamic rupture in poroelastic media. We verify our approach for double-couple point sources using independent methods including a semi-analytical solution and a finite-difference scheme and a homogeneous full-space and a poroelastic layer-over-half-space model, respectively. In a realistic carbon capture and storage reservoir scenario at the Sleipner site in the Utsira Formation, Norway, we model 3-D wave propagation through poroelastic sandstone layers separated by impermeable shale. Our results show a sudden change in the pressure field across material interfaces, which manifests as a discontinuity when viewed at the length scale of the dominant wavelengths of S or fast P waves. Accurately resolving the resulting steep pressure gradient dramatically increases the computational demands, requiring high-resolution modelling. We show that the Gassmann elastic equivalent model yields almost identical results to the fully poroelastic model when focusing solely on solid particle velocities. We extend this approach using suitable numerical fluxes to 3-D dynamic rupture simulations in complex fault systems, presenting the first 3-D scenarios that combine poroelastic media with geometrically complex, multifault rupture dynamics and tetrahedral meshes. Our findings reveal that, in contrast to modelling wave propagation only, poroelastic materials significantly alter rupture characteristics compared to using elastic equivalent media since the elastic equivalent fails to capture the evolution of pore pressure. Particularly in fault branching scenarios, the Biot coefficient plays a key role in either promoting or inhibiting fault activation. In some cases, ruptures are diverted to secondary faults, while in others, poroelastic effects induce rupture arrest. In a fault zone dynamic rupture model, we find poroelasticity aiding pulse-like rupture. A healing front is induced by the reduced pore pressure due to reflected waves from the boundaries of the poroelastic damage zone. Our results highlight that poroelastic effects are important for realistic simulations of seismic waves and earthquake rupture dynamics. In particular, our poroelastic simulations may offer new insights on the complexity of multifault rupture dynamics, fault-to-fault interaction and seismic wave propagation in realistic models of the Earth’s subsurface.},

We introduce a new code generator (“ChainForge”) that fuses subsequent batched matrix multiplications (“GEMMs”) into a single GPU kernel, holding intermediate results in shared memory as long as necessary. The generator operates as an external module linked against SeisSol's domain specific language YATeTo and, as a result, the original SeisSol source code remains mainly unchanged. In this paper, we discuss several challenges related to automatic fusion of GPU kernels and provide solutions to them. By and large, we gain \$\$ \approx \$\$60\% in performance of SeisSol's wave propagation solver using Fused-GEMMs compared to the original GPU implementation. We demonstrated this on benchmarks as well as on a real production scenario simulating the Northridge 1994 earthquake.},

abstract = {The numerical solution of partial differential equations is at the heart of many grand challenges in supercomputing. Solvers based on high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretisation have been shown to scale on large supercomputers with excellent performance and efficiency if the implementation exploits all levels of parallelism and is tailored to the specific architecture. However, every year new supercomputers emerge and the list of hardware-specific considerations grows simultaneously with the list of desired features in a DG code. Thus, we believe that a sustainable DG code needs an abstraction layer to implement the numerical scheme in a suitable language. We explore the possibility to abstract the numerical scheme as small tensor operations, describe them in a domain-specific language (DSL) resembling the Einstein notation, and to map them to small General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication routines. The compiler for our DSL implements classic optimisations that are used for large tensor contractions, and we present novel optimisation techniques such as equivalent sparsity patterns and optimal index permutations for temporary tensors. Our application examples, which include the earthquake simulation software SeisSol, show that the generated kernels achieve over 50\% peak performance of a recent 48-core Skylake system while the DSL considerably simplifies the implementation.},

With hierarchical methods like Multilevel Delayed Acceptance (MLDA) drastically reducing compute cost, sampling Bayesian posteriors for computationally intensive models becomes increasingly feasible. Pushing MLDA towards the strong scaling regime (i.e. high compute resources, short time-to-solution) remains a challenge: Even though MLDA only requires a moderate number of high-accuracy simulation runs, it inherits the sequential chain structure and need for chain burn-in from Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).We present fully asynchronous parallel prefetching for MLDA, adding an axis of scalability complementary to forward model parallelization and parallel chains. A thorough scaling analysis demonstrates that prefetching is advantageous in strong scaling scenarios. We investigate the behavior of prefetching MLDA in small-scale test problems. A large-scale geophysics application, namely parameter identification for non-linear earthquake modelling, highlights interaction with coarse-level quality and model scalability.},

abstract={Megathrust faults host the largest earthquakes on Earth, which can trigger cascading hazards such as devastating tsunamis. Determining characteristics that control subduction-zone earthquake and tsunami dynamics is critical to mitigate megathrust hazards but is impeded by structural complexity, large spatio-temporal scales and scarce or asymmetric instrumental coverage. Here we use high-performance computing multi-physics simulations to show that tsunami genesis and earthquake dynamics are controlled by along-arc variability in regional tectonic stresses together with depth-dependent variations in rigidity and yield strength of near-fault sediments. We aim to identify dominant regional factors controlling megathrust hazards. To this end, we demonstrate how to unify and verify the required initial conditions for geometrically complex, multi-physics earthquake--tsunami modelling from interdisciplinary geophysical observations. We present large-scale computational models of the 2004 Sumatra--Andaman earthquake and Indian Ocean tsunami that reconcile near- and far-field seismic, geodetic, geological, and tsunami observations and reveal tsunamigenic trade-offs between slip to the trench, splay faulting and bulk yielding of the accretionary wedge. Our computational capabilities render possible the incorporation of present and emerging high-resolution observations into dynamic-rupture-tsunami models and will be applicable to other large megathrust earthquakes.

As pre-earthquake Pf magnitude increases, effective normal stress and fault shear strength decrease. As a result, magnitude, slip, peak slip rate, stress drop, and rupture velocity of the scenario earthquakes decrease. Comparison of results with observations of the 2004 earthquake support that pre-earthquake Pf averages near 97\% of lithostatic pressure, leading to pre-earthquake average shear and effective normal tractions of 4–5 and 22 MPa. The megathrust in these scenarios is weak, in terms of low mean shear traction at static failure and low dynamic friction coefficient during rupture. Apparent co-seismic principal stress rotations and absolute post-seismic stresses in these scenarios are consistent with the variety of observed aftershock focal mechanisms. In all scenarios, the mean apparent stress rotations are larger above than below the megathrust. Scenarios with larger Pf magnitudes exhibit lower mean apparent principal stress rotations. We further evaluate pre-earthquake Pf depth distribution. If Pf follows a sublithostatic gradient, pre-earthquake effective normal stress increases with depth. If Pf follows the lithostatic gradient exactly, then this normal stress is constant, shifting peak slip and peak slip rate updip. This renders constraints on near-trench strength and constitutive behavior crucial for mitigating hazard. These scenarios provide opportunity for future calibration with site-specific measurements to constrain dynamically plausible megathrust strength and Pf gradients.},
