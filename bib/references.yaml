  abstract: "We present a dynamic rupture model of the 2016 Mw 7.8 Kaik\u014Dura earthquake\
    \ to unravel the event\u2019s riddles in a physics-based manner and provide insight\
    \ on the mechanical viability of competing hypotheses proposed to explain them.\
    \ Our model reproduces key characteristics of the event and constraints puzzling\
    \ features inferred from high-quality observations including a large gap separating\
    \ surface rupture traces, the possibility of significant slip on the subduction\
    \ interface, the non-rupture of the Hope fault, and slow apparent rupture speed.\
    \ We show that the observed rupture cascade is dynamically consistent with regional\
    \ stress estimates and a crustal fault network geometry inferred from seismic\
    \ and geodetic data. We propose that the complex fault system operates at low\
    \ apparent friction thanks to the combined effects of overpressurized fluids,\
    \ low dynamic friction and stress concentrations induced by deep fault creep."

  abstract: "The dynamics and potential size of earthquakes depend crucially on rupture\
    \ transfers between adjacent fault segments. To accurately describe earthquake\
    \ source dynamics, numerical models can account for realistic fault geometries\
    \ and rheologies such as nonlinear inelastic processes off the slip interface.\
    \ We present implementation, verification and application of off-fault Drucker\u2013\
    Prager plasticity in the open source software SeisSol (www.seissol.org). SeisSol\
    \ is based on an arbitrary high-order derivative modal Discontinuous Galerkin\
    \ method using unstructured, tetrahedral meshes specifically suited for complex\
    \ geometries. Two implementation approaches are detailed, modelling plastic failure\
    \ either employing subelemental quadrature points or switching to nodal basis\
    \ coefficients. At fine fault discretizations, the nodal basis approach is up\
    \ to six\_times more efficient in terms of computational costs while yielding\
    \ comparable accuracy. Both methods are verified in community benchmark problems\
    \ and by 3-D numerical h- and p-refinement studies with heterogeneous initial\
    \ stresses. We observe no spectral convergence for on-fault quantities with respect\
    \ to a given reference solution, but rather discuss a limitation to low-order\
    \ convergence for heterogeneous 3-D dynamic rupture problems. For simulations\
    \ including plasticity, a high fault resolution may be less crucial than commonly\
    \ assumed, due to the regularization of peak slip rate and an increase of the\
    \ minimum cohesive zone width. In large-scale dynamic rupture simulations based\
    \ on the 1992 Landers earthquake, we observe high rupture complexity including\
    \ reverse slip, direct branching and dynamic triggering. The spatiotemporal distribution\
    \ of rupture transfers are altered distinctively by plastic energy absorption,\
    \ correlated with locations of geometrical fault complexity. Computational cost\
    \ increases by 7\u2009per\u2009cent when accounting for off-fault plasticity in\
    \ the demonstrating application. Our results imply that the combination of fully\
    \ 3-D dynamic modelling, complex fault geometries and off-fault plastic yielding\
    \ is important to realistically capture dynamic rupture transfers in natural fault\
    \ systems."

  abstract: We present a high-resolution simulation of the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake,
    including non-linear frictional failure on a megathrustsplay fault system. Our
    method exploits unstructured meshes capturing the complicated geometries in subduction
    zones that are crucial to understand large earthquakes and tsunami generation.
    These up-to-date largest and longest dynamic rupture simulations enable analysis
    of dynamic source effects on the seafloor displacements.To tackle the extreme
    size of this scenario an end-to-end optimization of the simulation code SeisSol
    was necessary. We implemented a new cache-aware wave propagation scheme and optimized
    the dynamic rupture kernels using code generation. We established a novel clustered
    local-time-stepping scheme for dynamic rupture. In total, we achieved a speed-up
    of 13.6 compared to the previous implementation. For the Sumatra scenario with
    221 million elements this reduced the time-to-solution to 13.9 hours on 86, 016
    Haswell cores. Furthermore, we used asynchronous output to overlap I/O and compute
    time.
