- abstract: "Numerical simulations of earthquakes and seismic wave propagation require\
    \ accurate material models of the solid Earth. In contrast to purely elastic rheology,\
    \ poroelasticity accounts for pore fluid pressure and fluid flow in porous media.\
    \ Poroelastic effects can alter both the seismic wave field and the dynamic rupture\
    \ characteristics of earthquakes. For example, the presence of fluids may affect\
    \ cascading multifault ruptures, potentially leading to larger-than-expected earthquakes.\
    \ However, incorporating poroelastic coupling into the elastodynamic wave equations\_\
    increases the computational complexity of numerical simulations compared to elastic\
    \ or viscoelastic material models, as the underlying partial differential equations\_\
    become stiff. In this study, we use a Discontinuous Galerkin solver with Arbitrary\
    \ High-Order DERivative time stepping of the poroelastic wave equations\_implemented\
    \ in the open-source software SeisSol to simulate 3-D complex seismic wave propagation\
    \ and 3-D dynamic rupture in poroelastic media. We verify our approach for double-couple\
    \ point sources using independent methods including a semi-analytical solution\
    \ and a finite-difference scheme and a homogeneous full-space and a poroelastic\
    \ layer-over-half-space model, respectively. In a realistic carbon capture and\
    \ storage reservoir scenario at the Sleipner site in the Utsira Formation, Norway,\
    \ we model 3-D wave propagation through poroelastic sandstone layers separated\
    \ by impermeable shale. Our results show a sudden change in the pressure field\
    \ across material interfaces, which manifests as a discontinuity when viewed at\
    \ the length scale of the dominant wavelengths of S or fast P waves. Accurately\
    \ resolving the resulting steep pressure gradient dramatically increases the computational\
    \ demands, requiring high-resolution modelling. We show that the Gassmann elastic\
    \ equivalent model yields almost identical results to the fully poroelastic model\
    \ when focusing solely on solid particle velocities. We extend this approach using\
    \ suitable numerical fluxes to 3-D dynamic rupture simulations in complex fault\
    \ systems, presenting the first 3-D scenarios that combine poroelastic media with\
    \ geometrically complex, multifault rupture dynamics and tetrahedral meshes. Our\
    \ findings reveal that, in contrast to modelling wave propagation only, poroelastic\
    \ materials significantly alter rupture characteristics compared to using elastic\
    \ equivalent media since the elastic equivalent fails to capture the evolution\
    \ of pore pressure. Particularly in fault branching scenarios, the Biot coefficient\
    \ plays a key role in either promoting or inhibiting fault activation. In some\
    \ cases, ruptures are diverted to secondary faults, while in others, poroelastic\
    \ effects induce rupture arrest. In a fault zone dynamic rupture model, we find\
    \ poroelasticity aiding pulse-like rupture. A healing front is induced by the\
    \ reduced pore pressure due to reflected waves from the boundaries of the poroelastic\
    \ damage zone. Our results highlight that poroelastic effects are important for\
    \ realistic simulations of seismic waves and earthquake rupture dynamics. In particular,\
    \ our poroelastic simulations may offer new insights on the complexity of multifault\
    \ rupture dynamics, fault-to-fault interaction and seismic wave propagation in\
    \ realistic models of the Earth's subsurface."

- abstract: Abstract The nonlinear mechanical responses of rocks and soils to seismic
    waves play an important role in earthquake physics, influencing ground motion
    from source to site. Continuous geophysical monitoring, such as ambient noise
    interferometry, has revealed co-seismic wave speed reductions extending tens of
    kilometers from earthquake sources. However, the mechanisms governing these changes
    remain challenging to model, especially at regional scales. Using a nonlinear
    damage model constrained by laboratory experiments, we develop and apply an open-source
    3D discontinuous Galerkin method to simulate regional co-seismic wave speed changes
    during the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake. We find pronounced spatial variations
    of co-seismic wave speed reduction, ranging from \<0.01% to \>50%, particularly
    close to the source and within the Kathmandu Basin, while disagreement with observations
    remains. The most significant reduction occurs within the sedimentary basin and
    varies with basin depths, whereas wave speed reductions correlate with the fault
    slip distribution near the source. By comparing ground motions from simulations
    with elastic, viscoelastic, elastoplastic, and nonlinear damage rheologies, we
    demonstrate that the nonlinear damage model effectively captures low-frequency
    ground motion amplification due to strain-dependent wave speed reductions in soft
    sediments. We verify the accuracy of our approach through comparisons with analytical
    solutions and assess its scalability on high-performance computing systems. The
    model shows near-linear strong and weak scaling up to 2,048 nodes, enabling efficient
    large-scale simulations. Our findings provide a physics-based framework to quantify
    nonlinear earthquake effects and emphasize the importance of damage-induced wave
    speed variations for seismic hazard assessment and ground motion predictions.

    models, determining model parameters and meaningful confidence regions from observed

- abstract: Summary This study shows how GPU performance of the ADER discontinuous
    Galerkin method in SeisSol (an earthquake simulation software) can be further
    improved while preserving its original design that ensures high CPU performance.
    We introduce a new code generator ("ChainForge") that fuses subsequent batched
    matrix multiplications ("GEMMs") into a single GPU kernel, holding intermediate
    results in shared memory as long as necessary. The generator operates as an external
    module linked against SeisSol's domain specific language YATeTo and, as a result,
    the original SeisSol source code remains mainly unchanged. In this paper, we discuss
    several challenges related to automatic fusion of GPU kernels and provide solutions
    to them. By and large, we gain \$\$ `\approx `{=latex}\$\$60% in performance of
    SeisSol's wave propagation solver using Fused-GEMMs compared to the original GPU
    implementation. We demonstrated this on benchmarks as well as on a real production
    scenario simulating the Northridge 1994 earthquake.

- abstract: Megathrust faults host the largest earthquakes on Earth, which can trigger
    cascading hazards such as devastating tsunamis. Determining characteristics that
    control subduction-zone earthquake and tsunami dynamics is critical to mitigate
    megathrust hazards but is impeded by structural complexity, large spatio-temporal
    scales and scarce or asymmetric instrumental coverage. Here we use high-performance
    computing multi-physics simulations to show that tsunami genesis and earthquake
    dynamics are controlled by along-arc variability in regional tectonic stresses
    together with depth-dependent variations in rigidity and yield strength of near-fault
    sediments. We aim to identify dominant regional factors controlling megathrust
    hazards. To this end, we demonstrate how to unify and verify the required initial
    conditions for geometrically complex, multi-physics earthquake--tsunami modelling
    from interdisciplinary geophysical observations. We present large-scale computational
    models of the 2004 Sumatra--Andaman earthquake and Indian Ocean tsunami that reconcile
    near- and far-field seismic, geodetic, geological, and tsunami observations and
    reveal tsunamigenic trade-offs between slip to the trench, splay faulting and
    bulk yielding of the accretionary wedge. Our computational capabilities render
    possible the incorporation of present and emerging high-resolution observations
    into dynamic-rupture-tsunami models and will be applicable to other large megathrust
    earthquakes. Our findings highlight the importance of regional-scale structural
    heterogeneity to decipher megathrust hazards.

  title: An efficient ADER-DG local time stepping scheme for 3D HPC simulation of
    seismic waves in poroelastic media
  type: article-journal
  volume: 455
  year: 2022
- abstract: Many applications from the fields of seismology and geoengineering require
    simulations of seismic waves in porous media. Biot's theory of poroelasticity
    describes the coupling between solid and fluid phases and introduces a stiff reactive
    source term (Darcy's Law) into the elastodynamic wave equations, thereby increasing
    computational cost of respective numerical solvers and motivating efficient methods
    utilising High-Performance Computing. We present a novel realisation of the discontinuous
    Galerkin scheme with Arbitrary High-Order DERivative time stepping (ADER-DG) that
    copes with stiff source terms. To integrate this source term with a reasonable
    time step size, we utilise an element-local space-time predictor, which needs
    to solve medium-sized linear systems -- each with 1,000 to 10,000 unknowns --
    in each element update (i.e., billions of times). We present a novel block-wise
    back-substitution algorithm for solving these systems efficiently, thus enabling
    large-scale 3D simulations. In comparison to LU decomposition, we reduce the number
    of floating-point operations by a factor of up to 25, when using polynomials of
    degree 6. The block-wise back-substitution is mapped to a sequence of small matrix-matrix
    multiplications, for which code generators are available to generate highly optimised
    code. We verify the new solver thoroughly against analytical and semi-analytical
    reference solutions in problems of increasing complexity. We demonstrate high-order
    convergence of the scheme for 3D problems. We verify the correct treatment of
    point sources and boundary conditions, including homogeneous and heterogeneous
    full space problems as well as problems with traction-free boundary conditions.
    In addition, we compare against a finite difference solution for a newly defined
    3D layer over half-space problem containing an internal material interface and
    free surface. We find that extremely high accuracy is required to accurately resolve
    the slow, diffusive P-wave at a or near a free surface, while we also demonstrate
    that solid particle velocities are not affected by coarser resolutions. We demonstrate
    that by using a clustered local time stepping scheme, time to solution is reduced
    by a factor of 6 to 10 compared to global time stepping. We conclude our study
    with a scaling and performance analysis on the SuperMUC-NG supercomputer, demonstrating
    our implementation's high computational efficiency and its potential for extreme-scale
    simulations.

- abstract: "Abstract We study the effects of pore fluid pressure (Pf) on the pre-earthquake,\
    \ near-fault stress state, and 3-D earthquake rupture dynamics through six scenarios\
    \ utilizing a structural model based on the 2004 Mw 9.1 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake.\
    \ As pre-earthquake Pf magnitude increases, effective normal stress and fault\
    \ shear strength decrease. As a result, magnitude, slip, peak slip rate, stress\
    \ drop, and rupture velocity of the scenario earthquakes decrease. Comparison\
    \ of results with observations of the 2004 earthquake support that pre-earthquake\
    \ Pf averages near 97% of lithostatic pressure, leading to pre-earthquake average\
    \ shear and effective normal tractions of 4--5 and 22\_MPa. The megathrust in\
    \ these scenarios is weak, in terms of low mean shear traction at static failure\
    \ and low dynamic friction coefficient during rupture. Apparent co-seismic principal\
    \ stress rotations and absolute post-seismic stresses in these scenarios are consistent\
    \ with the variety of observed aftershock focal mechanisms. In all scenarios,\
    \ the mean apparent stress rotations are larger above than below the megathrust.\
    \ Scenarios with larger Pf magnitudes exhibit lower mean apparent principal stress\
    \ rotations. We further evaluate pre-earthquake Pf depth distribution. If Pf follows\
    \ a sublithostatic gradient, pre-earthquake effective normal stress increases\
    \ with depth. If Pf follows the lithostatic gradient exactly, then this normal\
    \ stress is constant, shifting peak slip and peak slip rate updip. This renders\
    \ constraints on near-trench strength and constitutive behavior crucial for mitigating\
    \ hazard. These scenarios provide opportunity for future calibration with site-specific\
    \ measurements to constrain dynamically plausible megathrust strength and Pf gradients."

- abstract: The numerical solution of partial differential equations is at the heart
    of many grand challenges in supercomputing. Solvers based on high-order discontinuous
    Galerkin (DG) discretisation have been shown to scale on large supercomputers
    with excellent performance and efficiency if the implementation exploits all levels
    of parallelism and is tailored to the specific architecture. However, every year
    new supercomputers emerge and the list of hardware-specific considerations grows
    simultaneously with the list of desired features in a DG code. Thus, we believe
    that a sustainable DG code needs an abstraction layer to implement the numerical
    scheme in a suitable language. We explore the possibility to abstract the numerical
    scheme as small tensor operations, describe them in a domain-specific language
    (DSL) resembling the Einstein notation, and to map them to small General Matrix-Matrix
    Multiplication routines. The compiler for our DSL implements classic optimisations
    that are used for large tensor contractions, and we present novel optimisation
    techniques such as equivalent sparsity patterns and optimal index permutations
    for temporary tensors. Our application examples, which include the earthquake
    simulation software SeisSol, show that the generated kernels achieve over 50%
    peak performance of a recent 48-core Skylake system while the DSL considerably
    simplifies the implementation.

- abstract: We present an extension of the earthquake simulation software SeisSol
    to support seismic wave propagation in fully triclinic anisotropic materials.
    To our best knowledge, SeisSol is one of the few open-source codes that offer
    this feature for simulations at petascale performance and beyond. We employ a
    Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with arbitrary high-order derivative (ADER)
    time stepping. Here, we present a novel implementation of fully physical anisotropy
    with a two-sided Godunov flux and local time stepping. We validate our implementation
    on various benchmarks and present convergence analysis with respect to analytic
    solutions. An application example of seismic waves scattering around the Zugspitze
    in the Bavarian Alps demonstrates the capabilities of our implementation to solve
    geophysics problems fast.

- abstract: "We present a dynamic rupture model of the 2016 Mw 7.8 Kaik\u014Dura earthquake\
    \ to unravel the event's riddles in a physics-based manner and provide insight\
    \ on the mechanical viability of competing hypotheses proposed to explain them.\
    \ Our model reproduces key characteristics of the event and constraints puzzling\
    \ features inferred from high-quality observations including a large gap separating\
    \ surface rupture traces, the possibility of significant slip on the subduction\
    \ interface, the non-rupture of the Hope fault, and slow apparent rupture speed.\
    \ We show that the observed rupture cascade is dynamically consistent with regional\
    \ stress estimates and a crustal fault network geometry inferred from seismic\
    \ and geodetic data. We propose that the complex fault system operates at low\
    \ apparent friction thanks to the combined effects of overpressurized fluids,\
    \ low dynamic friction and stress concentrations induced by deep fault creep."

- abstract: "The dynamics and potential size of earthquakes depend crucially on rupture\
    \ transfers between adjacent fault segments. To accurately describe earthquake\
    \ source dynamics, numerical models can account for realistic fault geometries\
    \ and rheologies such as nonlinear inelastic processes off the slip interface.\
    \ We present implementation, verification and application of off-fault Drucker--Prager\
    \ plasticity in the open source software SeisSol (www.seissol.org). SeisSol is\
    \ based on an arbitrary high-order derivative modal Discontinuous Galerkin method\
    \ using unstructured, tetrahedral meshes specifically suited for complex geometries.\
    \ Two implementation approaches are detailed, modelling plastic failure either\
    \ employing subelemental quadrature points or switching to nodal basis coefficients.\
    \ At fine fault discretizations, the nodal basis approach is up to six\_times\
    \ more efficient in terms of computational costs while yielding comparable accuracy.\
    \ Both methods are verified in community benchmark problems and by 3-D numerical\
    \ h- and p-refinement studies with heterogeneous initial stresses. We observe\
    \ no spectral convergence for on-fault quantities with respect to a given reference\
    \ solution, but rather discuss a limitation to low-order convergence for heterogeneous\
    \ 3-D dynamic rupture problems. For simulations including plasticity, a high fault\
    \ resolution may be less crucial than commonly assumed, due to the regularization\
    \ of peak slip rate and an increase of the minimum cohesive zone width. In large-scale\
    \ dynamic rupture simulations based on the 1992 Landers earthquake, we observe\
    \ high rupture complexity including reverse slip, direct branching and dynamic\
    \ triggering. The spatiotemporal distribution of rupture transfers are altered\
    \ distinctively by plastic energy absorption, correlated with locations of geometrical\
    \ fault complexity. Computational cost increases by 7\u2009per\u2009cent when\
    \ accounting for off-fault plasticity in the demonstrating application. Our results\
    \ imply that the combination of fully 3-D dynamic modelling, complex fault geometries\
    \ and off-fault plastic yielding is important to realistically capture dynamic\

    some domain as the response while the regressors are scalars. Collections of time
    series as well as 2D or 3D images can be considered as functional responses. We
    provide a hands-on introduction for a flexible semiparametric approach for function-on-scalar
    regression, using spatially referenced time series of ground velocity measurements
    from large-scale simulated earthquake data as a running example. We discuss important
    practical considerations and challenges in the modelling process and outline best
    practices. The outline of our approach is complemented by comprehensive R code,

- abstract: We present a high-resolution simulation of the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake,
    including non-linear frictional failure on a megathrustsplay fault system. Our
    method exploits unstructured meshes capturing the complicated geometries in subduction
    zones that are crucial to understand large earthquakes and tsunami generation.
    These up-to-date largest and longest dynamic rupture simulations enable analysis
    of dynamic source effects on the seafloor displacements.To tackle the extreme
    size of this scenario an end-to-end optimization of the simulation code SeisSol
    was necessary. We implemented a new cache-aware wave propagation scheme and optimized
    the dynamic rupture kernels using code generation. We established a novel clustered
    local-time-stepping scheme for dynamic rupture. In total, we achieved a speed-up
    of 13.6 compared to the previous implementation. For the Sumatra scenario with
    221 million elements this reduced the time-to-solution to 13.9 hours on 86, 016
    Haswell cores. Furthermore, we used asynchronous output to overlap I/O and compute
    time.

- abstract: We present ASAGI, an open-source library with a simple interface to access
    Cartesian material and geographic datasets in massively parallel simulations with
    dynamically adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). ASAGI distributes geographic datasets
    over all compute nodes storing only a portion of the dataset on each node. An
    automatic replication mechanism copies the data between nodes to assure fast local
    access even after load migration in the application. We demonstrate ASAGI's preparedness
    for up-to-petascale simulations in three use cases. We simulate a Tsunami on 512
    cores and a porous media flow on up to 8,192 cores of SuperMUC with the AMR framework
    sam(oa)2. We also run an earthquake simulation with SeiSol on 65,536 cores. For
    all applications, ASAGI provides large complex 3D material datasets required for
    the realistic scenarios. The NUMA-awareness of ASAGI turned out to be especially
    useful for the hybrid MPI+OpenMP parallelization of both codes.

- abstract: Accurate and efficient numerical methods to simulate dynamic earthquake
    rupture and wave propagation in complex media and complex fault geometries are
    needed to address fundamental questions in earthquake dynamics, to integrate seismic
    and geodetic data into emerging approaches for dynamic source inversion, and to
    generate realistic physics-based earthquake scenarios for hazard assessment. Modeling
    of spontaneous earthquake rupture and seismic wave propagation by a high-order
    discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method combined with an arbitrarily high-order derivatives
    (ADER) time integration method was introduced in two dimensions by de la Puente
    et al. (2009). The ADER-DG method enables high accuracy in space and time and
    discretization by unstructured meshes. Here we extend this method to three-dimensional
    dynamic rupture problems. The high geometrical flexibility provided by the usage
    of tetrahedral elements and the lack of spurious mesh reflections in the ADER-DG
    method allows the refinement of the mesh close to the fault to model the rupture
    dynamics adequately while concentrating computational resources only where needed.
    Moreover, ADER-DG does not generate spurious high-frequency perturbations on the
    fault and hence does not require artificial Kelvin-Voigt damping. We verify our
    three-dimensional implementation by comparing results of the SCEC TPV3 test problem
    with two well-established numerical methods, finite differences, and spectral
    boundary integral. Furthermore, a convergence study is presented to demonstrate
    the systematic consistency of the method. To illustrate the capabilities of the
    high-order accurate ADER-DG scheme on unstructured meshes, we simulate an earthquake
    scenario, inspired by the 1992 Landers earthquake, that includes curved faults,
    fault branches, and surface topography.

- abstract: We introduce the application of an arbitrary high-order derivative (ADER)
    discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method to simulate earthquake rupture dynamics. The
    ADER-DG method uses triangles as computational cells which simplifies the process
    of discretization of very complex surfaces and volumes by using external automated
    tools. Discontinuous Galerkin methods are well suited for solving dynamic rupture
    problems in the velocity-stress formulation as the variables are naturally discontinuous
    at the interface between two elements. Therefore, the fault has to be honored
    by the computational mesh. The so-called Riemann problem can be solved to obtain
    well defined values of the variables at the discontinuity itself. Fault geometries
    of high complexity can be modeled thanks to the flexibility of unstructured meshes,
    which solves a major bottleneck of other high-order numerical methods. Additionally,
    element refinement and coarsening are easily controlled in the meshing process
    to better resolve the near-fault area of the model. The fundamental properties
    of the method are shown, as well as a series of validating exercises with reference
    solutions and a comparison with the well-established finite difference, boundary
    integral, and spectral element methods, in order to test the accuracy of our formulation.
    An example of dynamic rupture on a nonplanar fault based upon the Landers 1992
    earthquake fault system is presented to illustrate the main potentials of the
    new method.

- abstract: We present a quantitative accuracy analysis of the Discontinuous Galerkin
    Finite-Element method for the simulation of seismic wave propagation on tetrahedral
    meshes. Several parameters are responsible for the accuracy of results, such as
    the chosen approximation order, the spatial discretization, that is, number of
    elements per wavelength, and the propagation distance of the waves due to numerical
    dispersion and dissipation. As error norm we choose the time--frequency representation
    of the envelope and phase misfit of seismograms to assess the accuracy of the
    resulting seismograms since this provides the time evolution of the spectral content
    and allows for the clear separation of amplitude and phase errors obtained by
    the numerical method. Our results can be directly used to set up the necessary
    modelling parameters for practical applications, such as the minimum approximation
    order for a given mesh spacing to reach a desired accuracy. Finally, we apply
    our results to the well-acknowledged LOH.1 and LOH.3 problems of the SPICE Code
    Validation project, including heterogeneous material and the free surface boundary
    condition, and compare our solutions with those of other methods. In general,
    we want to stress the increasing importance of certain standard procedures to
    facilitate future code validations and comparisons of results in the community
    of numerical seismology.

- abstract: We have developed a new numerical method to solve the heterogeneous poroelastic
    wave equations in bounded three-dimensional domains. This method is a discontinuous
    Galerkin method that achieves arbitrary high-order accuracy on unstructured tetrahedral
    meshes for the low-frequency range and the inviscid case. By using Biot's equations
    and Darcy's dynamic laws, we have built a scheme that can successfully model wave
    propagation in fluid-saturated porous media when anisotropy of the pore structure
    is allowed. Zero-inflow fluxes are used as absorbing boundary conditions. A continuous
    arbitrary high-order derivatives time integration is used for the high-frequency
    inviscid case, whereas a space-time discontinuous scheme is applied for the low-frequency
    case. We conducted a numerical convergence test of the proposed methods. We used
    a series of examples to quantify the quality of our numerical results, comparing
    them to analytic solutions as well as numerical solutions obtained by other methodologies.
    In particular, a large scale 3D reservoir model showed the method's suitability
    to solve poroelastic wave-propagation problems for complex geometries using unstructured
    tetrahedral meshes. The resulting method is proved to be high-order accurate in
    space and time, stable for the low-frequency case, and asymptotically consistent
    with the diffusion limit.

- abstract: We present a new numerical method to solve the heterogeneous elastic anisotropic
    wave equation with arbitrary high-order accuracy in space and time on unstructured
    tetrahedral meshes. Using the most general Hooke's tensor we derive the velocity-stress
    formulation leading to a linear hyperbolic system which accounts for the variation
    of the material properties depending on direction. This approach allows for the
    accurate modelling even of the most general crystalline symmetry class, the triclinic
    anisotropy, as no interpolation of material properties to particular mesh vertices
    is necessary. The proposed method combines the Discontinuous Galerkin method with
    the arbitrary high-order derivatives (ADER) time integration approach using arbitrary
    high-order derivatives of the piecewise polynomial representation of the unknown
    solution. The discontinuities of this piecewise polynomial approximation at element
    interfaces permit the application of the well-established theory of finite volumes
    and numerical fluxes across element interfaces obtained by the solution of derivative
    Riemann problems. Due to the novel ADER time integration technique the scheme
    provides the same approximation order in space and time automatically. A numerical
    convergence study confirms that the new scheme achieves the desired arbitrary
    high-order accuracy even for anisotropic material on unstructured tetrahedral
    meshes. Furthermore, it shows that higher accuracy can be reached with higher-order
    schemes while reducing computational cost and storage space. To this end, we also
    present a new Godunov-type numerical flux for anisotropic material and compare
    its accuracy with a computationally simpler Rusanov flux. As a further extension,
    we include the coupling of anisotropy and viscoelastic attenuation based on the
    Generalized Maxwell Body rheology and the mean and deviatoric stress concepts.
    Finally, we validate the new scheme by comparing the results of our simulations
    to an analytic solution as well as to spectral element computations.

- abstract: We present a new numerical method to solve the heterogeneous anelastic,
    seismic wave equations with arbitrary high order accuracy in space and time on
    3-D unstructured tetrahedral meshes. Using the velocity--stress formulation provides
    a linear hyperbolic system of equations with source terms that is completed by
    additional equations for the anelastic functions including the strain history
    of the material. These additional equations result from the rheological model
    of the generalized Maxwell body and permit the incorporation of realistic attenuation
    properties of viscoelastic material accounting for the behaviour of elastic solids
    and viscous fluids. The proposed method combines the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG)
    finite element (FE) method with the ADER approach using Arbitrary high order DERivatives
    for flux calculations. The DG approach, in contrast to classical FE methods, uses
    a piecewise polynomial approximation of the numerical solution which allows for
    discontinuities at element interfaces. Therefore, the well-established theory
    of numerical fluxes across element interfaces obtained by the solution of Riemann
    problems can be applied as in the finite volume framework. The main idea of the
    ADER time integration approach is a Taylor expansion in time in which all time
    derivatives are replaced by space derivatives using the so-called Cauchy---Kovalewski
    procedure which makes extensive use of the governing PDE. Due to the ADER time
    integration technique the same approximation order in space and time is achieved
    automatically and the method is a one-step scheme advancing the solution for one
    time step without intermediate stages. To this end, we introduce a new unrolled
    recursive algorithm for efficiently computing the Cauchy--Kovalewski procedure
    by making use of the sparsity of the system matrices. The numerical convergence
    analysis demonstrates that the new schemes provide very high order accuracy even
    on unstructured tetrahedral meshes while computational cost and storage space
    for a desired accuracy can be reduced when applying higher degree approximation
    polynomials. In addition, we investigate the increase in computing time, when
    the number of relaxation mechanisms due to the generalized Maxwell body are increased.
    An application to a well-acknowledged test case and comparisons with analytic
    and reference solutions, obtained by different well-established numerical methods,
    confirm the performance of the proposed method. Therefore, the development of
    the highly accurate ADER---DG approach for tetrahedral meshes including viscoelastic
    material provides a novel, flexible and efficient numerical technique to approach
    3-D wave propagation problems including realistic attenuation and complex geometry.

- abstract: We present a new numerical method to solve the heterogeneous elastic wave
    equations formulated as a linear hyperbolic system using first-order derivatives
    with arbitrary high-order accuracy in space and time on 3-D unstructured tetrahedral
    meshes. The method combines the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) Finite Element (FE)
    method with the ADER approach using Arbitrary high-order DERivatives for flux
    calculation. In the DG framework, in contrast to classical FE methods, the numerical
    solution is approximated by piecewise polynomials which allow for discontinuities
    at element interfaces. Therefore, the well-established theory of numerical fluxes
    across element interfaces obtained by the solution of Riemann-Problems can be
    applied as in the finite volume framework. To define a suitable flux over the
    element surfaces, we solve so-called Generalized Riemann-Problems (GRP) at the
    element interfaces. The GRP solution provides simultaneously a numerical flux
    function as well as a time-integration method. The main idea is a Taylor expansion
    in time in which all time-derivatives are replaced by space derivatives using
    the so-called Cauchy--Kovalewski or Lax--Wendroff procedure which makes extensive
    use of the governing PDE. The numerical solution can thus be advanced for one
    time step without intermediate stages as typical, for example, for classical Runge--Kutta
    time stepping schemes. Due to the ADER time-integration technique, the same approximation
    order in space and time is achieved automatically. Furthermore, the projection
    of the tetrahedral elements in physical space on to a canonical reference tetrahedron
    allows for an efficient implementation, as many computations of 3-D integrals
    can be carried out analytically beforehand. Based on a numerical convergence analysis,
    we demonstrate that the new schemes provide very high order accuracy even on unstructured
    tetrahedral meshes and computational cost and storage space for a desired accuracy
    can be reduced by higher-order schemes. Moreover, due to the choice of the basis
    functions for the piecewise polynomial approximation, the new ADER--DG method
    shows spectral convergence on tetrahedral meshes. An application of the new method
    to a well-acknowledged test case and comparisons with analytical and reference
    solutions, obtained by different well-established methods, confirm the performance
    of the proposed method. Therefore, the development of the highly accurate ADER--DG
    approach for tetrahedral meshes provides a numerical technique to approach 3-D
    wave propagation problems in complex geometry with unforeseen accuracy.

- abstract: We present a new numerical approach to solve the elastic wave equation
    in heterogeneous media in the presence of externally given source terms with arbitrary
    high-order accuracy in space and time on unstructured triangular meshes. We combine
    a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with the ideas of the ADER time integration
    approach using Arbitrary high-order DERivatives. The time integration is performed
    via the so-called Cauchy-Kovalewski procedure using repeatedly the governing partial
    differential equation itself. In contrast to classical finite element methods
    we allow for discontinuities of the piecewise polynomial approximation of the
    solution at element interfaces. This way, we can use the well-established theory
    of fluxes across element interfaces based on the solution of Riemann problems
    as developed in the finite volume framework. In particular, we replace time derivatives
    in the Taylor expansion of the time integration procedure by space derivatives
    to obtain a numerical scheme of the same high order in space and time using only
    one single explicit step to evolve the solution from one time level to another.
    The method is specially suited for linear hyperbolic systems such as the heterogeneous
    elastic wave equations and allows an efficient implementation. We consider continuous
    sources in space and time and point sources characterized by a Delta distribution
    in space and some continuous source time function. Hereby, the method is able
    to deal with point sources at any position in the computational domain that does
    not necessarily need to coincide with a mesh point. Interpolation is automatically
    performed by evaluation of test functions at the source locations. The convergence
    analysis demonstrates that very high accuracy is retained even on strongly irregular
    meshes and by increasing the order of the ADER--DG schemes computational time
    and storage space can be reduced remarkably. Applications of the proposed method
    to Lamb's Problem, a problem of strong material heterogeneities and to an example
    of global seismic wave propagation finally confirm its accuracy, robustness and
    high flexibility.
