- abstract: "Fault zones exhibit geometrical complexity and are often surrounded by\
    \ multiscale fracture networks within their damage zones, potentially influencing\
    \ rupture dynamics and near\u2010field ground motions. In this study, we investigate\
    \ the ground\u2010motion characteristics of cascading ruptures across damage zone\
    \ fracture networks of moderate\u2010size earthquakes (Mw\_5.5--6.0) using high\u2010\
    resolution 3D dynamic rupture simulations. Our models feature a listric normal\
    \ fault surrounded by more than 800 fractures, emulating a major fault and its\
    \ associated damage zone. We analyze three cases: a cascading rupture propagating\
    \ within the fracture network (Mw\_5.5), a non\u2010cascading main\u2010fault\
    \ rupture with off\u2010fault fracture slip (Mw\_6.0), and a main\u2010fault rupture\
    \ without a fracture network (Mw\_6.0). Cascading ruptures within the fracture\
    \ network produce distinct ground\u2010motion signatures with enriched high\u2010\
    frequency content, arising from simultaneous slip of multiple fractures and parts\
    \ of the main fault, resembling source coda\u2010wave\u2010like signatures. This\
    \ case shows elevated near\u2010field characteristic frequency (fc) and stress\
    \ drop, approximately an order of magnitude higher than the estimation directly\
    \ on the fault of the dynamic rupture simulation. The inferred fc of the modeled\
    \ vertical ground\u2010motion components reflects the complexity of the radiation\
    \ pattern and rupture directivity of fracture\u2010network cascading earthquakes.\
    \ We show that this is consistent with observations of strong azimuthal dependence\
    \ of corner frequency in the 2009--2016 central Apennines, Italy, earthquake,\
    \ sequence. Simulated ground motions from fracture\u2010network cascading ruptures\
    \ also show pronounced azimuthal variations in peak ground acceleration (PGA),\
    \ peak ground velocity, and pseudospectral acceleration, with average PGA nearly\
    \ double that of the non\u2010cascading cases. Cascading ruptures radiate high\u2010\
    frequency seismic energy, yield nontypical ground\u2010motion characteristics\
    \ including coda\u2010wave\u2010like signatures, and may result in a significantly\
    \ higher seismologically inferred stress drop and PGA. Such outcomes emphasize\
    \ the critical role of fault\u2010zone complexity in affecting rupture dynamics\
    \ and seismic radiation and have important implications for physics\u2010based\
    \ seismic hazard assessment."

- abstract: "Numerical simulations of earthquakes and seismic wave propagation require\
    \ accurate material models of the solid Earth. In contrast to purely elastic rheology,\
    \ poroelasticity accounts for pore fluid pressure and fluid flow in porous media.\
    \ Poroelastic effects can alter both the seismic wave field and the dynamic rupture\
    \ characteristics of earthquakes. For example, the presence of fluids may affect\
    \ cascading multifault ruptures, potentially leading to larger-than-expected earthquakes.\
    \ However, incorporating poroelastic coupling into the elastodynamic wave equations\_\
    increases the computational complexity of numerical simulations compared to elastic\
    \ or viscoelastic material models, as the underlying partial differential equations\_\
    become stiff. In this study, we use a Discontinuous Galerkin solver with Arbitrary\
    \ High-Order DERivative time stepping of the poroelastic wave equations\_implemented\
    \ in the open-source software SeisSol to simulate 3-D complex seismic wave propagation\
    \ and 3-D dynamic rupture in poroelastic media. We verify our approach for double-couple\
    \ point sources using independent methods including a semi-analytical solution\
    \ and a finite-difference scheme and a homogeneous full-space and a poroelastic\
    \ layer-over-half-space model, respectively. In a realistic carbon capture and\
    \ storage reservoir scenario at the Sleipner site in the Utsira Formation, Norway,\
    \ we model 3-D wave propagation through poroelastic sandstone layers separated\
    \ by impermeable shale. Our results show a sudden change in the pressure field\
    \ across material interfaces, which manifests as a discontinuity when viewed at\
    \ the length scale of the dominant wavelengths of S or fast P waves. Accurately\
    \ resolving the resulting steep pressure gradient dramatically increases the computational\
    \ demands, requiring high-resolution modelling. We show that the Gassmann elastic\
    \ equivalent model yields almost identical results to the fully poroelastic model\
    \ when focusing solely on solid particle velocities. We extend this approach using\
    \ suitable numerical fluxes to 3-D dynamic rupture simulations in complex fault\
    \ systems, presenting the first 3-D scenarios that combine poroelastic media with\
    \ geometrically complex, multifault rupture dynamics and tetrahedral meshes. Our\
    \ findings reveal that, in contrast to modelling wave propagation only, poroelastic\
    \ materials significantly alter rupture characteristics compared to using elastic\
    \ equivalent media since the elastic equivalent fails to capture the evolution\
    \ of pore pressure. Particularly in fault branching scenarios, the Biot coefficient\
    \ plays a key role in either promoting or inhibiting fault activation. In some\
    \ cases, ruptures are diverted to secondary faults, while in others, poroelastic\
    \ effects induce rupture arrest. In a fault zone dynamic rupture model, we find\
    \ poroelasticity aiding pulse-like rupture. A healing front is induced by the\
    \ reduced pore pressure due to reflected waves from the boundaries of the poroelastic\
    \ damage zone. Our results highlight that poroelastic effects are important for\
    \ realistic simulations of seismic waves and earthquake rupture dynamics. In particular,\
    \ our poroelastic simulations may offer new insights on the complexity of multifault\
    \ rupture dynamics, fault-to-fault interaction and seismic wave propagation in\
    \ realistic models of the Earth's subsurface."

- abstract: Abstract The nonlinear mechanical responses of rocks and soils to seismic
    waves play an important role in earthquake physics, influencing ground motion
    from source to site. Continuous geophysical monitoring, such as ambient noise
    interferometry, has revealed co-seismic wave speed reductions extending tens of
    kilometers from earthquake sources. However, the mechanisms governing these changes
    remain challenging to model, especially at regional scales. Using a nonlinear
    damage model constrained by laboratory experiments, we develop and apply an open-source
    3D discontinuous Galerkin method to simulate regional co-seismic wave speed changes
    during the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake. We find pronounced spatial variations
    of co-seismic wave speed reduction, ranging from \<0.01% to \>50%, particularly
    close to the source and within the Kathmandu Basin, while disagreement with observations
    remains. The most significant reduction occurs within the sedimentary basin and
    varies with basin depths, whereas wave speed reductions correlate with the fault
    slip distribution near the source. By comparing ground motions from simulations
    with elastic, viscoelastic, elastoplastic, and nonlinear damage rheologies, we
    demonstrate that the nonlinear damage model effectively captures low-frequency
    ground motion amplification due to strain-dependent wave speed reductions in soft
    sediments. We verify the accuracy of our approach through comparisons with analytical
    solutions and assess its scalability on high-performance computing systems. The
    model shows near-linear strong and weak scaling up to 2,048 nodes, enabling efficient
    large-scale simulations. Our findings provide a physics-based framework to quantify
    nonlinear earthquake effects and emphasize the importance of damage-induced wave
    speed variations for seismic hazard assessment and ground motion predictions.

    models, determining model parameters and meaningful confidence regions from observed

    regime (i.e. high compute resources, short time-to-solution) remains a challenge:
    Even though MLDA only requires a moderate number of high-accuracy simulation runs,

    MLDA, adding an axis of scalability complementary to forward model parallelization
    and parallel chains. A thorough scaling analysis demonstrates that prefetching
    is advantageous in strong scaling scenarios. We investigate the behavior of prefetching

- abstract: "Abstract Seismic faults are surrounded by damaged rocks with reduced\
    \ rigidity and enhanced attenuation. These damaged fault zone structures can amplify\
    \ seismic waves and affect earthquake dynamics, yet they are typically omitted\
    \ in physics-based regional ground motion simulations. We report on the significant\
    \ effects of a shallow, flower-shaped fault zone in foreshock-mainshock 3D dynamic\
    \ rupture models of the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence. We find that the\
    \ fault zone structure both amplifies and reduces ground motions not only locally\
    \ but at distances exceeding 100\_km. This impact on ground motions is frequency-\
    \ and magnitude-dependent, particularly affecting higher frequency ground motions\
    \ from the foreshock because its corner frequency is closer to the fault zone's\
    \ fundamental eigenfrequency. Within the fault zone, the shallow transition to\
    \ a velocity-strengthening frictional regime leads to a depth-dependent peak slip\
    \ rate increase of up to 70% and confines fault zone-induced supershear transitions\
    \ mostly to the fault zone's velocity-weakening roots. However, the interplay\
    \ of fault zone waves, free surface reflections, and rupture directivity can generate\
    \ localized supershear rupture, even in narrow velocity-strengthening regions,\
    \ which are typically thought to inhibit supershear rupture. This study demonstrates\
    \ that shallow fault zone structures may significantly affect intermediate- and\
    \ far-field ground motions and cause localized supershear rupture penetrating\
    \ into velocity-strengthening regions, with important implications for seismic\

    \ with the potential to address current paradoxes in earthquake mechanics, and\

    \ fully 3D dynamic rupture simulations caused by fluid injection on a target fault\

    \ faults with high S values (low rupturing potential), even minor variations in\
    \ Dc (from 0.45 to 0.6\_mm) have a substantial effect on the rupture propagation\
    \ and the ultimate earthquake size. Modest spatial variations of dynamic stress\

    \ is associated with a nearly constant cohesive zone size. Moreover, the residual\

    \ nearly zero. This means that an initially crack-like rupture becomes a pulse-like\
    \ rupture during spontaneous arrest. These findings highlight the complex dynamics\
    \ of small induced earthquakes, which differ from solutions obtained from conventional\

- abstract: Near-field earthquake ground motions characterized by strong velocity
    pulses can cause extensive damage to buildings and structures. Such pulses were
    identified during the Mw 7.8 and Mw 7.5 earthquake doublet of the 2023 Turkey
    seismic sequence, potentially contributing to the extensive damage it caused.
    Therefore, a better understanding and characterization of pulse properties (e.g.
    period and amplitude) and their underlying physical factors are crucial for earthquake-resistant
    design. In this study, we characterize the velocity pulses reported in observed
    records and synthetic waveforms generated by a three-dimensional (3D) dynamic
    rupture simulation of the Mw 7.8 event. We observed significant variability in
    the pulse properties of the observed records in near-fault regions, particularly
    regarding their orientations. This variability was not fully captured by the dynamic
    rupture simulation. Our results indicate that directivity effects are not the
    only factors influencing pulse characteristics in this earthquake doublet. While
    site effects (e.g. basin effects) may influence pulse characteristics at some
    stations, local heterogeneities in slip amplitude, orientations, and fault geometries
    can be critical in generating or influencing pulse properties in this earthquake
    doublet.

    \ using P\u2010wave signals with sufficient azimuthal coverage yields hypocenter\
    \ estimates with generally good horizontal but poor vertical resolution. The short\
    \ local source--receiver distances result in incomplete separation of P\u2010\
    \ and S\u2010wave arrivals during backprojection. Numerical tests show that the\
    \ relatively large S\u2010wave amplitudes can influence coherent P\u2010wave stacks,\
    \ resulting in large location errors. Our combined P\u2010 and S\u2010wave backprojection\
    \ approach mitigates the influence of the large S\u2010wave amplitude and improves\
    \ the depth resolution significantly. The average depth offset to the reference\
    \ catalog locations reduces from \u22651.4\_km to \u223C91\_m. Third, 3D numerical\
    \ simulations demonstrate that backprojection swimming patterns are not merely\
    \ processing or configuration artifacts. We show that the swimming patterns correlate\
    \ with and can resolve the source focal mechanism when the azimuthal wavefield\
    \ sampling is sufficiently complete. Our work demonstrates that the backprojection\
    \ techniques can help to better constrain important properties of local\u2010\
    scale microseismicity."

- abstract: Summary This study shows how GPU performance of the ADER discontinuous
    Galerkin method in SeisSol (an earthquake simulation software) can be further
    improved while preserving its original design that ensures high CPU performance.
    We introduce a new code generator ("ChainForge") that fuses subsequent batched
    matrix multiplications ("GEMMs") into a single GPU kernel, holding intermediate
    results in shared memory as long as necessary. The generator operates as an external
    module linked against SeisSol's domain specific language YATeTo and, as a result,
    the original SeisSol source code remains mainly unchanged. In this paper, we discuss
    several challenges related to automatic fusion of GPU kernels and provide solutions
    to them. By and large, we gain \$\$ `\approx `{=latex}\$\$60% in performance of
    SeisSol's wave propagation solver using Fused-GEMMs compared to the original GPU
    implementation. We demonstrated this on benchmarks as well as on a real production
    scenario simulating the Northridge 1994 earthquake.

- abstract: Earthquakes vary in size over many orders of magnitude, often rupturing
    in complex multifault and multievent sequences. Despite the large number of observed
    earthquakes, the scaling of the earthquake energy budget remains enigmatic. We
    propose that fundamentally different fracture processes govern small and large
    earthquakes. We combined seismological observations with physics-based earthquake
    models, finding that both dynamic weakening and restrengthening effects are non-negligible
    in the energy budget of small earthquakes. We established a linear scaling relationship
    between fracture energy and fault size and a break in scaling with slip. We applied
    this scaling using supercomputing and unveiled large dynamic rupture earthquake
    cascades involving &gt;700 multiscale fractures within a fault damage zone. We
    provide a simple explanation for seismicity across all scales with implications
    for comprehending earthquake genesis and multifault rupture cascades. Earthquakes
    vary in size, with the largest and most complex also being the most dangerous.
    The challenge is trying to figure out whether the information gleaned from smaller
    events can simply be scaled up to understand larger events. Gabriel et al. combined
    seismic observations with physics-based earthquake models to determine the differences.
    Their results outline conditions for when multiple-fault, complex ruptures occur
    and show that fundamentally different fracture processes govern both large and
    small earthquakes. ---Brent Grocholski

- abstract: Abstract The Mediterranean Hellenic Arc subduction zone (HASZ) has generated
    several \$`\mathrm{M}`{=latex}\_W`\ge `{=latex}\$8 earthquakes and tsunamis. Seismic-probabilistic
    tsunami hazard assessment typically utilizes uniform or stochastic earthquake
    models, which may not represent dynamic rupture and tsunami generation complexity.
    We present an ensemble of ten 3D dynamic rupture earthquake scenarios for the
    HASZ, utilizing a realistic slab geometry. Our simplest models use uniform along-arc
    pre-stresses or a single circular initial stress asperity. We then introduce progressively
    more complex models varying initial shear stress along-arc, multiple asperities
    based on scale-dependent critical slip weakening distance, and a most complex
    model blending all aforementioned heterogeneities. Thereby, regional initial conditions
    are constrained without relying on detailed geodetic locking models. Varying epicentral
    locations in the simplest, homogeneous model leads to different rupture speeds
    and moment magnitudes. We observe dynamic fault slip penetrating the shallow slip-strengthening
    region and affecting seafloor uplift. Off-fault plastic deformation can double
    vertical seafloor uplift. A single-asperity model generates a \$`\mathrm{M}`{=latex}\_W\~\$8
    scenario resembling the 1303 Crete earthquake. Using along-strike varying initial
    stresses results in \$`\mathrm{M}`{=latex}\_W\~\$8.0--8.5 dynamic rupture scenarios
    with diverse slip rates and uplift patterns. The model with the most heterogeneous
    initial conditions yields a \$`\mathrm{M}`{=latex}\_W\~\$7.5 scenario. Dynamic
    rupture complexity in prestress and fracture energy tends to lower earthquake
    magnitude but enhances tsunamigenic displacements. Our results offer insights
    into the dynamics of potential large Hellenic Arc megathrust earthquakes and may
    inform future physics-based joint seismic and tsunami hazard assessments.

    (AGWs) in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) total electron content (TEC)
    observations, models of the earthquake-atmosphere-ionosphere dynamics, essential
    for validating data-driven studies, remain limited. We present the results of
    three-dimensional numerical simulations encompassing the entire coupling from
    Earth's interior to the ionosphere during the \$M\_w\$ 7.8 2016 Kaikoura earthquake.
    Incorporating the impact of data/model uncertainties in estimating the ionospheric
    state, the results show a good agreement between observed and simulated slant
    TEC (sTEC) signals, assessed through a set of metrics. The signals exhibit intricate
    waveforms, resulting from the integrated nature of TEC and phase cancellation
    effects, emphasizing the significance of direct signal comparisons along realistic

    and dynamic source models, the study demonstrates the quantifiable sensitivity
    of sTEC to AGW source specifications, pointing to their utility in the analysis
    of coupled dynamics.

- abstract: Abstract Previous geodetic and teleseismic observations of the 2021 \$M\_`\mathrm{w}`{=latex}\$7.4
    Maduo earthquake imply surprising but difficult-to-constrain complexity, including
    rupture across multiple fault segments and supershear rupture. Here, we present
    an integrated analysis of multi-fault 3D dynamic rupture models, high-resolution
    optical correlation analysis, and joint optical-InSAR slip inversion. Our preferred
    model, validated by the teleseismic multi-peak moment rate release, includes unilateral
    eastward double-onset supershear speeds and cascading rupture dynamically triggering
    two adjacent fault branches. We propose that pronounced along-strike variation
    in fracture energy, complex fault geometries, and multi-scale variable prestress
    drives this event's complex rupture dynamics. We illustrate how supershear transition
    has signatures in modeled and observed off-fault deformation. Our study opens
    new avenues to combine observations and models to better understand complex earthquake
    dynamics, including local and potentially repeating supershear episodes across
    immature faults or under heterogeneous stress and strength conditions, which are
    potentially not unusual.

- abstract: Abstract Slow slip events (SSEs) have been observed in spatial and temporal
    proximity to megathrust earthquakes in various subduction zones, including the
    2014 Mw 7.3 Guerrero, Mexico earthquake which was preceded by a Mw 7.6 SSE. However,
    the underlying physics connecting SSEs to earthquakes remains elusive. Here, we
    link 3D slow-slip cycle models with dynamic rupture simulations across the geometrically
    complex flat-slab Cocos plate boundary. Our physics-based models reproduce key
    regional geodetic and teleseismic fault slip observations on timescales from decades
    to seconds. We find that accelerating SSE fronts transiently increase shear stress
    at the down-dip end of the seismogenic zone, modulated by the complex geometry
    beneath the Guerrero segment. The shear stresses cast by the migrating fronts
    of the 2014 Mw 7.6 SSE are significantly larger than those during the three previous
    episodic SSEs that occurred along the same portion of the megathrust. We show
    that the SSE transient stresses are large enough to nucleate earthquake dynamic
    rupture and affect rupture dynamics. However, additional frictional asperities
    in the seismogenic part of the megathrust are required to explain the observed
    complexities in the coseismic energy release and static surface displacements
    of the Guerrero earthquake. We conclude that it is crucial to jointly analyze
    the long- and short-term interactions and complexities of SSEs and megathrust
    earthquakes across several (a)seismic cycles accounting for megathrust geometry.
    Our study has important implications for identifying earthquake precursors and
    understanding the link between transient and sudden megathrust faulting processes.

- abstract: 'The observational difficulties and the complexity of earthquake physics
    have rendered seismic hazard assessment largely empirical. Despite increasingly
    high-quality geodetic, seismic and field observations, data-driven earthquake
    imaging yields stark differences and physics-based models explaining all observed
    dynamic complexities are elusive. Here we present data-assimilated three-dimensional
    dynamic rupture models of California''s biggest earthquakes in more than 20`\thinspace`{=latex}years:
    the moment magnitude (Mw) 6.4 Searles Valley and Mw`\thinspace`{=latex}7.1 Ridgecrest
    sequence, which ruptured multiple segments of a non-vertical quasi-orthogonal
    conjugate fault system1. Our models use supercomputing to find the link between
    the two earthquakes. We explain strong-motion, teleseismic, field mapping, high-rate
    global positioning system and space geodetic datasets with earthquake physics.
    We find that regional structure, ambient long- and short-term stress, and dynamic
    and static fault system interactions driven by overpressurized fluids and low
    dynamic friction are conjointly crucial to understand the dynamics and delays
    of the sequence. We demonstrate that a joint physics-based and data-driven approach
    can be used to determine the mechanics of complex fault systems and earthquake
    sequences when reconciling dense earthquake recordings, three-dimensional regional
    structure and stress models. We foresee that physics-based interpretation of big
    observational datasets will have a transformative impact on future geohazard mitigation.'

- abstract: "Frictional heating during earthquake rupture raises the fault\u2010zone\
    \ fluid pressure, which affects dynamic rupture and seismic radiation. Here, we\
    \ investigate two key parameters governing thermal pressurization of pore fluids\
    \ -- hydraulic diffusivity and shear\u2010zone half\u2010width -- and their effects\
    \ on earthquake rupture dynamics, kinematic source properties, and ground motions.\
    \ We conduct 3D strike\u2010slip dynamic rupture simulations assuming a rate\u2010\
    and\u2010state dependent friction law with strong velocity weakening coupled to\
    \ thermal\u2010pressurization of pore fluids. Dynamic rupture evolution and ground\
    \ shaking are densely evaluated across the fault and Earth's surface to analyze\
    \ the variations of rupture parameters (slip, peak slip rate, rupture speed, and\
    \ rise time), correlations among rupture parameters, and variability of peak ground\
    \ velocity. Our simulations reveal how variations in thermal\u2010pressurization\
    \ affect earthquake rupture properties. We find that the mean slip and rise time\
    \ decrease with increasing hydraulic diffusivity, whereas mean rupture speed and\
    \ peak slip\u2010rate remain almost constant. Mean slip, peak slip\u2010rate,\
    \ and rupture speed decrease with increasing shear\u2010zone half\u2010width,\
    \ whereas mean rise time increases. Shear\u2010zone half\u2010width distinctly\
    \ affects the correlation between rupture parameters, especially for parameter\
    \ pairs (slip, rupture speed), (peak slip\u2010rate, rupture speed), and (rupture\
    \ speed, rise time). Hydraulic diffusivity has negligible effects on these correlations.\
    \ Variations in shear\u2010zone half\u2010width primarily impact rupture speed,\
    \ which then may affect other rupture parameters. We find a negative correlation\
    \ between slip and peak slip\u2010rate, unlike simpler dynamic rupture models.\
    \ Mean peak ground velocities decrease faster with increasing shear\u2010zone\
    \ half\u2010width than with increasing hydraulic diffusivity, whereas ground\u2010\
    motion variability is similarly affected by both the parameters. Our results show\
    \ that shear\u2010zone half\u2010width affects rupture dynamics, kinematic rupture\
    \ properties, and ground shaking more strongly than hydraulic diffusivity. We\
    \ interpret the importance of shear\u2010zone half\u2010width based on the characteristic\
    \ time of diffusion. Our findings may inform pseudodynamic rupture generators\
    \ and guide future studies on how to account for thermal\u2010pressurization effects."

- abstract: "Tsunami generation by offshore earthquakes is a problem of scientific\
    \ interest and practical relevance, and one that requires numerical modelling\
    \ for data interpretation and hazard assessment. Most numerical models utilize\
    \ two-step methods with one-way coupling between separate earthquake and tsunami\
    \ models, based on approximations that might limit the applicability and accuracy\
    \ of the resulting solution. In particular, standard methods focus exclusively\
    \ on tsunami wave modelling, neglecting larger amplitude ocean acoustic and seismic\
    \ waves that are superimposed on tsunami waves in the source region. In this study,\
    \ we compare four earthquake-tsunami modelling methods. We identify dimensionless\
    \ parameters to quantitatively approximate dominant wave modes in the earthquake-tsunami\
    \ source region, highlighting how the method assumptions affect the results and\
    \ discuss which methods are appropriate for various applications such as interpretation\
    \ of data from offshore instruments in the source region. Most methods couple\
    \ a 3-D solid earth model, which provides the seismic wavefield or at least the\
    \ static elastic displacements, with a 2-D depth-averaged shallow water tsunami\
    \ model. Assuming the ocean is incompressible and tsunami propagation is negligible\
    \ over the earthquake duration leads to the instantaneous source method, which\
    \ equates the static earthquake seafloor uplift with the initial tsunami sea surface\
    \ height. For longer duration earthquakes, it is appropriate to follow the time-dependent\
    \ source method, which uses time-dependent earthquake seafloor velocity as a forcing\
    \ term in the tsunami mass balance. Neither method captures ocean acoustic or\
    \ seismic waves, motivating more advanced methods that capture the full wavefield.\
    \ The superposition method of Saito et\_al. solves the 3-D elastic and acoustic\
    \ equations\_to model the seismic wavefield and response of a compressible ocean\
    \ without gravity. Then, changes in sea surface height from the zero-gravity solution\
    \ are used as a forcing term in a separate tsunami simulation, typically run with\
    \ a shallow water solver. A superposition of the earthquake and tsunami solutions\
    \ provides an approximation to the complete wavefield. This method is algorithmically\
    \ a two-step method. The complete wavefield is captured in the fully coupled method,\
    \ which utilizes a coupled solid Earth and compressible ocean model with gravity.\
    \ The fully coupled method, recently incorporated into the 3-D open-source code\
    \ SeisSol, simultaneously solves earthquake rupture, seismic waves and ocean response\
    \ (including gravity). We show that the superposition method emerges as an approximation\
    \ to the fully coupled method subject to often well-justified assumptions. Furthermore,\
    \ using the fully coupled method, we examine how the source spectrum and ocean\
    \ depth influence the expression of oceanic Rayleigh waves. Understanding the\
    \ range of validity of each method, as well as its computational expense, facilitates\
    \ the selection of modelling methods for the accurate assessment of earthquake\
    \ and tsunami hazards and the interpretation of data from offshore instruments."

- abstract: "Abstract Physics-based simulations of earthquake ground motion are useful\
    \ to complement recorded ground motions. However, the computational expense of\
    \ performing numerical simulations hinders their applicability to tasks that require\
    \ real-time solutions or ensembles of solutions for different earthquake sources.\
    \ To enable rapid physics-based solutions, we present a reduced-order modeling\

    \ 3D wave propagation simulations at the location of the 2008 MW 5.4 Chino Hills\
    \ earthquake using double-couple sources with varying depth and focal mechanisms.\
    \ These simulations resolve frequencies \u22641.0\_Hz and include topography,\
    \ viscoelastic attenuation, and S-wave speeds \u2265500\_m/s. We evaluate the\
    \ accuracy of the interpolated POD reduced-order model (ROM) as a function of\
    \ the approximation method. Comparing the radial basis function (RBF), multilayer\

- abstract: "Abstract The H\xFAsav\xEDk-Flatey Fault Zone (HFFZ) is the largest strike-slip\
    \ fault in Iceland and poses a high seismic risk to coastal communities. To investigate\
    \ physics-based constraints on earthquake hazards, we construct three fault system\

- abstract: The EU Center of Excellence for Exascale in Solid Earth (ChEESE) develops
    exascale transition capabilities in the domain of Solid Earth, an area of geophysics
    rich in computational challenges embracing different approaches to exascale (capability,
    capacity, and urgent computing). The first implementation phase of the project
    (ChEESE-1P; 2018--2022) addressed scientific and technical computational challenges
    in seismology, tsunami science, volcanology, and magnetohydrodynamics, in order
    to understand the phenomena, anticipate the impact of natural disasters, and contribute
    to risk management. The project initiated the optimisation of 10 community flagship
    codes for the upcoming exascale systems and implemented 12 Pilot Demonstrators
    that combine the flagship codes with dedicated workflows in order to address the
    underlying capability and capacity computational challenges. Pilot Demonstrators
    reaching more mature Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) were further enabled in
    operational service environments on critical aspects of geohazards such as long-term
    and short-term probabilistic hazard assessment, urgent computing, and early warning
    and probabilistic forecasting. Partnership and service co-design with members
    of the project Industry and User Board (IUB) leveraged the uptake of results across
    multiple research institutions, academia, industry, and public governance bodies
    (e.g. civil protection agencies). This article summarises the implementation strategy
    and the results from ChEESE-1P, outlining also the underpinning concepts and the
    roadmap for the on-going second project implementation phase (ChEESE-2P; 2023--2026).

- abstract: Megathrust faults host the largest earthquakes on Earth, which can trigger
    cascading hazards such as devastating tsunamis. Determining characteristics that
    control subduction-zone earthquake and tsunami dynamics is critical to mitigate
    megathrust hazards but is impeded by structural complexity, large spatio-temporal
    scales and scarce or asymmetric instrumental coverage. Here we use high-performance
    computing multi-physics simulations to show that tsunami genesis and earthquake
    dynamics are controlled by along-arc variability in regional tectonic stresses
    together with depth-dependent variations in rigidity and yield strength of near-fault
    sediments. We aim to identify dominant regional factors controlling megathrust
    hazards. To this end, we demonstrate how to unify and verify the required initial
    conditions for geometrically complex, multi-physics earthquake--tsunami modelling
    from interdisciplinary geophysical observations. We present large-scale computational
    models of the 2004 Sumatra--Andaman earthquake and Indian Ocean tsunami that reconcile
    near- and far-field seismic, geodetic, geological, and tsunami observations and
    reveal tsunamigenic trade-offs between slip to the trench, splay faulting and
    bulk yielding of the accretionary wedge. Our computational capabilities render
    possible the incorporation of present and emerging high-resolution observations
    into dynamic-rupture-tsunami models and will be applicable to other large megathrust
    earthquakes. Our findings highlight the importance of regional-scale structural
    heterogeneity to decipher megathrust hazards.

- abstract: Many applications from the fields of seismology and geoengineering require
    simulations of seismic waves in porous media. Biot's theory of poroelasticity
    describes the coupling between solid and fluid phases and introduces a stiff reactive
    source term (Darcy's Law) into the elastodynamic wave equations, thereby increasing
    computational cost of respective numerical solvers and motivating efficient methods
    utilising High-Performance Computing. We present a novel realisation of the discontinuous
    Galerkin scheme with Arbitrary High-Order DERivative time stepping (ADER-DG) that
    copes with stiff source terms. To integrate this source term with a reasonable
    time step size, we utilise an element-local space-time predictor, which needs
    to solve medium-sized linear systems -- each with 1,000 to 10,000 unknowns --
    in each element update (i.e., billions of times). We present a novel block-wise
    back-substitution algorithm for solving these systems efficiently, thus enabling
    large-scale 3D simulations. In comparison to LU decomposition, we reduce the number
    of floating-point operations by a factor of up to 25, when using polynomials of
    degree 6. The block-wise back-substitution is mapped to a sequence of small matrix-matrix
    multiplications, for which code generators are available to generate highly optimised
    code. We verify the new solver thoroughly against analytical and semi-analytical
    reference solutions in problems of increasing complexity. We demonstrate high-order
    convergence of the scheme for 3D problems. We verify the correct treatment of
    point sources and boundary conditions, including homogeneous and heterogeneous
    full space problems as well as problems with traction-free boundary conditions.
    In addition, we compare against a finite difference solution for a newly defined
    3D layer over half-space problem containing an internal material interface and
    free surface. We find that extremely high accuracy is required to accurately resolve
    the slow, diffusive P-wave at a or near a free surface, while we also demonstrate
    that solid particle velocities are not affected by coarser resolutions. We demonstrate
    that by using a clustered local time stepping scheme, time to solution is reduced
    by a factor of 6 to 10 compared to global time stepping. We conclude our study
    with a scaling and performance analysis on the SuperMUC-NG supercomputer, demonstrating
    our implementation's high computational efficiency and its potential for extreme-scale
    simulations.

    \ networks that could pose a significant tsunami hazard. However, the dynamics\
    \ of multiple splay fault activation during megathrust earthquakes and the consequent\
    \ effects on tsunami generation are not well understood. We use a 2-D dynamic\

    \ due to a complex rupture branching process from the megathrust, all other splay\
    \ faults are activated either top down or bottom up by dynamic stress transfer\
    \ induced by trapped seismic waves. We ascribe these differences to local non-optimal\
    \ fault orientations and variable along-dip strength excess. Generally, rupture\
    \ on splay faults is facilitated by their favorable stress orientations and low\
    \ strength excess as a result of high pore-fluid pressures. The ensuing tsunami\
    \ modeled with non-linear 1-D shallow water equations consists of one high-amplitude\
    \ crest related to rupture on the longest splay fault and a second broader wave\
    \ packet resulting from slip on the other faults. This results in two episodes\
    \ of flooding and a larger run-up distance than the single long-wavelength (300\_\
    km) tsunami sourced by the megathrust-only rupture. Since splay fault activation\
    \ is determined by both variable stress and strength conditions and dynamic activation,\
    \ considering both tectonic and earthquake processes is relevant for understanding\

- abstract: "Abstract Despite decades-long debate over the mechanics of low-angle\
    \ normal faults (LANFs) dipping less than 30\xB0, many questions about their strength,\
    \ stress, and slip remain unresolved. Recent geologic and geophysical observations\
    \ have confirmed that gently dipping detachment faults can slip at such shallow\
    \ dips and host moderate-to-large earthquakes. Here, we analyze the first 3D dynamic\
    \ rupture models to assess how different stress and strength conditions affect\
    \ rupture characteristics of LANF earthquakes. We model observationally constrained\
    \ spontaneous rupture under different loading conditions on the active Mai'iu\
    \ fault in Papua New Guinea, which dips 16\xB0--24\xB0 at the surface and accommodates\
    \ \u223C8\_mm/yr of horizontal extension. We analyze four distinct fault-local\
    \ stress scenarios: (1) Andersonian extension, as inferred in the hanging wall;\
    \ (2) back-rotated principal stresses inferred paleopiezometrically from the exhumed\
    \ footwall; (3) favorably rotated principal stresses well-aligned for low-angle\
    \ normal-sense slip; and (4) Andersonian extension derived from depth-variable\
    \ static fault friction decreasing toward the surface. Our modeling suggests that\
    \ subcritically stressed detachment faults can host moderate earthquakes within\
    \ purely Andersonian stress fields. Near-surface rupture is impeded by free-surface\
    \ stress interactions and dynamic effects of the gently dipping geometry and frictionally\
    \ stable gouges of the shallowest portion of the fault. Although favorably inclined\
    \ principal stresses have been proposed for some detachments, these conditions\
    \ are not necessary for seismic slip on these faults. Our results demonstrate\

- abstract: The 2016 Central Italy earthquake sequence is characterized by remarkable
    rupture complexity, including highly heterogeneous slip across multiple faults
    in an extensional tectonic regime. The dense coverage and high quality of geodetic
    and seismic data allow us to image intriguing details of the rupture kinematics
    of the largest earthquake of the sequence, the Mw 6.5 October 30th, 2016 Norcia
    earthquake, such as an energetically weak nucleation phase. Several kinematic
    models suggest multiple fault planes rupturing simultaneously, however, the mechanical
    viability of such models is not guaranteed. Using 3D dynamic rupture and seismic
    wave propagation simulations accounting for two fault planes, we constrain "families"
    of spontaneous dynamic models informed by a high-resolution kinematic rupture
    model of the earthquake. These families differ in their parameterization of initial
    heterogeneous shear stress and strength in the framework of linear slip weakening
    friction. First, we dynamically validate the kinematically inferred two-fault
    geometry and rake inferences with models based on only depth-dependent stress
    and constant friction coefficients. Then, more complex models with spatially heterogeneous
    dynamic parameters allow us to retrieve slip distributions similar to the target
    kinematic model and yield good agreement with seismic and geodetic observations.
    We discuss the consistency of the assumed constant or heterogeneous static and
    dynamic friction coefficients with mechanical properties of rocks at 3-10 km depth
    characterizing the Italian Central Apennines and their local geological and lithological
    implications. We suggest that suites of well-fitting dynamic rupture models belonging
    to the same family generally exist and can be derived by exploiting the trade-offs
    between dynamic parameters. Our approach will be applicable to validate the viability
    of kinematic models and classify spontaneous dynamic rupture scenarios that match
    seismic and geodetic observations as well as geological constraints.

- abstract: The numerical solution of partial differential equations is at the heart
    of many grand challenges in supercomputing. Solvers based on high-order discontinuous
    Galerkin (DG) discretisation have been shown to scale on large supercomputers
    with excellent performance and efficiency if the implementation exploits all levels
    of parallelism and is tailored to the specific architecture. However, every year
    new supercomputers emerge and the list of hardware-specific considerations grows
    simultaneously with the list of desired features in a DG code. Thus, we believe
    that a sustainable DG code needs an abstraction layer to implement the numerical
    scheme in a suitable language. We explore the possibility to abstract the numerical
    scheme as small tensor operations, describe them in a domain-specific language
    (DSL) resembling the Einstein notation, and to map them to small General Matrix-Matrix
    Multiplication routines. The compiler for our DSL implements classic optimisations
    that are used for large tensor contractions, and we present novel optimisation
    techniques such as equivalent sparsity patterns and optimal index permutations
    for temporary tensors. Our application examples, which include the earthquake
    simulation software SeisSol, show that the generated kernels achieve over 50%
    peak performance of a recent 48-core Skylake system while the DSL considerably
    simplifies the implementation.

    To our best knowledge, SeisSol is one of the few open-source codes that offer
    this feature for simulations at petascale performance and beyond. We employ a

    \ source dynamics, numerical models can account for realistic fault geometries\
    \ and rheologies such as nonlinear inelastic processes off the slip interface.\
    \ We present implementation, verification and application of off-fault Drucker--Prager\
    \ plasticity in the open source software SeisSol (www.seissol.org). SeisSol is\
    \ based on an arbitrary high-order derivative modal Discontinuous Galerkin method\
    \ using unstructured, tetrahedral meshes specifically suited for complex geometries.\
    \ Two implementation approaches are detailed, modelling plastic failure either\
    \ employing subelemental quadrature points or switching to nodal basis coefficients.\
    \ At fine fault discretizations, the nodal basis approach is up to six\_times\
    \ more efficient in terms of computational costs while yielding comparable accuracy.\
    \ Both methods are verified in community benchmark problems and by 3-D numerical\
    \ h- and p-refinement studies with heterogeneous initial stresses. We observe\
    \ no spectral convergence for on-fault quantities with respect to a given reference\
    \ solution, but rather discuss a limitation to low-order convergence for heterogeneous\
    \ 3-D dynamic rupture problems. For simulations including plasticity, a high fault\
    \ resolution may be less crucial than commonly assumed, due to the regularization\
    \ of peak slip rate and an increase of the minimum cohesive zone width. In large-scale\
    \ dynamic rupture simulations based on the 1992 Landers earthquake, we observe\
    \ high rupture complexity including reverse slip, direct branching and dynamic\
    \ triggering. The spatiotemporal distribution of rupture transfers are altered\
    \ distinctively by plastic energy absorption, correlated with locations of geometrical\
    \ fault complexity. Computational cost increases by 7\u2009per\u2009cent when\
    \ accounting for off-fault plasticity in the demonstrating application. Our results\

    some domain as the response while the regressors are scalars. Collections of time
    series as well as 2D or 3D images can be considered as functional responses. We
    provide a hands-on introduction for a flexible semiparametric approach for function-on-scalar

    from large-scale simulated earthquake data as a running example. We discuss important
    practical considerations and challenges in the modelling process and outline best

- abstract: We present a high-resolution simulation of the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake,
    including non-linear frictional failure on a megathrustsplay fault system. Our
    method exploits unstructured meshes capturing the complicated geometries in subduction
    zones that are crucial to understand large earthquakes and tsunami generation.
    These up-to-date largest and longest dynamic rupture simulations enable analysis
    of dynamic source effects on the seafloor displacements.To tackle the extreme
    size of this scenario an end-to-end optimization of the simulation code SeisSol
    was necessary. We implemented a new cache-aware wave propagation scheme and optimized
    the dynamic rupture kernels using code generation. We established a novel clustered
    local-time-stepping scheme for dynamic rupture. In total, we achieved a speed-up
    of 13.6 compared to the previous implementation. For the Sumatra scenario with
    221 million elements this reduced the time-to-solution to 13.9 hours on 86, 016
    Haswell cores. Furthermore, we used asynchronous output to overlap I/O and compute
    time.

- abstract: We present ASAGI, an open-source library with a simple interface to access
    Cartesian material and geographic datasets in massively parallel simulations with
    dynamically adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). ASAGI distributes geographic datasets
    over all compute nodes storing only a portion of the dataset on each node. An
    automatic replication mechanism copies the data between nodes to assure fast local
    access even after load migration in the application. We demonstrate ASAGI's preparedness
    for up-to-petascale simulations in three use cases. We simulate a Tsunami on 512
    cores and a porous media flow on up to 8,192 cores of SuperMUC with the AMR framework
    sam(oa)2. We also run an earthquake simulation with SeiSol on 65,536 cores. For
    all applications, ASAGI provides large complex 3D material datasets required for
    the realistic scenarios. The NUMA-awareness of ASAGI turned out to be especially
    useful for the hybrid MPI+OpenMP parallelization of both codes.

- abstract: Accurate and efficient numerical methods to simulate dynamic earthquake
    rupture and wave propagation in complex media and complex fault geometries are
    needed to address fundamental questions in earthquake dynamics, to integrate seismic
    and geodetic data into emerging approaches for dynamic source inversion, and to
    generate realistic physics-based earthquake scenarios for hazard assessment. Modeling
    of spontaneous earthquake rupture and seismic wave propagation by a high-order
    discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method combined with an arbitrarily high-order derivatives
    (ADER) time integration method was introduced in two dimensions by de la Puente
    et al. (2009). The ADER-DG method enables high accuracy in space and time and
    discretization by unstructured meshes. Here we extend this method to three-dimensional
    dynamic rupture problems. The high geometrical flexibility provided by the usage
    of tetrahedral elements and the lack of spurious mesh reflections in the ADER-DG
    method allows the refinement of the mesh close to the fault to model the rupture
    dynamics adequately while concentrating computational resources only where needed.
    Moreover, ADER-DG does not generate spurious high-frequency perturbations on the
    fault and hence does not require artificial Kelvin-Voigt damping. We verify our
    three-dimensional implementation by comparing results of the SCEC TPV3 test problem
    with two well-established numerical methods, finite differences, and spectral
    boundary integral. Furthermore, a convergence study is presented to demonstrate
    the systematic consistency of the method. To illustrate the capabilities of the
    high-order accurate ADER-DG scheme on unstructured meshes, we simulate an earthquake
    scenario, inspired by the 1992 Landers earthquake, that includes curved faults,
    fault branches, and surface topography.

- abstract: "During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries observational seismologists\
    \ recorded primarily the earthquake-induced translational wave field, while the\
    \ rotational motion still remains poorly observed and investigated. We aim to\
    \ further understand the rotational ground motion and its relation to the translational\
    \ wave field, with a special emphasis on the near field, a few wavelengths away\
    \ from the hypocenter, where damage related to rotational motion might need to\
    \ be considered. A broad picture of the available values of rotational amplitudes\
    \ and their variability is obtained by gathering most of the published data on\
    \ strong rotational motion. To obtain a more detailed picture we perform a large\
    \ scale 3D numerical study of a strike-slip event in the Grenoble valley where\
    \ a combination of topographic, source, and site effects produces a realistic\
    \ wave field. We analyzed the synthetic dataset in terms of the rotational and\
    \ translational peak amplitudes and their dependence on two effects: nonlinear\
    \ soil behavior and source directivity. On a soft soil deposit, we observe peak\
    \ ground rotation of 1\_mrad and the peak ground rotation rate of 10 mrad/sec,\
    \ for an Mw\_6.0 event. Those values show a strong dependence on the hypocenter\
    \ location, the local site conditions, and the topographical features, inducing\
    \ a variability of almost one order of magnitude in a range of distances of 20\_\
    km. Finally, we compare our numerical results in terms of peak ground velocity\
    \ (PGV) versus peak ground rotation (PG\u03C9) with field data obtained at similar\
    \ scenarios (e.g., Parkfield) by array techniques to investigate the relation\
    \ between translational and rotational amplitudes expected in the near field for\
    \ shallow, medium-sized earthquakes. Results of our numerical simulation fit reasonably\
    \ well with those observed in past studies. Furthermore, the spatial variations\
    \ of the PGV/PG\u03C9 ratio show a trend, which is correlated with the velocity\
    \ structure of the model under study."

- abstract: We introduce the application of an arbitrary high-order derivative (ADER)
    discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method to simulate earthquake rupture dynamics. The
    ADER-DG method uses triangles as computational cells which simplifies the process
    of discretization of very complex surfaces and volumes by using external automated
    tools. Discontinuous Galerkin methods are well suited for solving dynamic rupture
    problems in the velocity-stress formulation as the variables are naturally discontinuous
    at the interface between two elements. Therefore, the fault has to be honored
    by the computational mesh. The so-called Riemann problem can be solved to obtain
    well defined values of the variables at the discontinuity itself. Fault geometries
    of high complexity can be modeled thanks to the flexibility of unstructured meshes,
    which solves a major bottleneck of other high-order numerical methods. Additionally,
    element refinement and coarsening are easily controlled in the meshing process
    to better resolve the near-fault area of the model. The fundamental properties
    of the method are shown, as well as a series of validating exercises with reference
    solutions and a comparison with the well-established finite difference, boundary
    integral, and spectral element methods, in order to test the accuracy of our formulation.
    An example of dynamic rupture on a nonplanar fault based upon the Landers 1992
    earthquake fault system is presented to illustrate the main potentials of the
    new method.

- abstract: We present a quantitative accuracy analysis of the Discontinuous Galerkin
    Finite-Element method for the simulation of seismic wave propagation on tetrahedral
    meshes. Several parameters are responsible for the accuracy of results, such as
    the chosen approximation order, the spatial discretization, that is, number of
    elements per wavelength, and the propagation distance of the waves due to numerical
    dispersion and dissipation. As error norm we choose the time--frequency representation
    of the envelope and phase misfit of seismograms to assess the accuracy of the
    resulting seismograms since this provides the time evolution of the spectral content
    and allows for the clear separation of amplitude and phase errors obtained by
    the numerical method. Our results can be directly used to set up the necessary
    modelling parameters for practical applications, such as the minimum approximation
    order for a given mesh spacing to reach a desired accuracy. Finally, we apply
    our results to the well-acknowledged LOH.1 and LOH.3 problems of the SPICE Code
    Validation project, including heterogeneous material and the free surface boundary
    condition, and compare our solutions with those of other methods. In general,
    we want to stress the increasing importance of certain standard procedures to
    facilitate future code validations and comparisons of results in the community
    of numerical seismology.

- abstract: We have developed a new numerical method to solve the heterogeneous poroelastic
    wave equations in bounded three-dimensional domains. This method is a discontinuous
    Galerkin method that achieves arbitrary high-order accuracy on unstructured tetrahedral
    meshes for the low-frequency range and the inviscid case. By using Biot's equations
    and Darcy's dynamic laws, we have built a scheme that can successfully model wave
    propagation in fluid-saturated porous media when anisotropy of the pore structure
    is allowed. Zero-inflow fluxes are used as absorbing boundary conditions. A continuous
    arbitrary high-order derivatives time integration is used for the high-frequency
    inviscid case, whereas a space-time discontinuous scheme is applied for the low-frequency
    case. We conducted a numerical convergence test of the proposed methods. We used
    a series of examples to quantify the quality of our numerical results, comparing
    them to analytic solutions as well as numerical solutions obtained by other methodologies.
    In particular, a large scale 3D reservoir model showed the method's suitability
    to solve poroelastic wave-propagation problems for complex geometries using unstructured
    tetrahedral meshes. The resulting method is proved to be high-order accurate in
    space and time, stable for the low-frequency case, and asymptotically consistent
    with the diffusion limit.

- abstract: We present a new numerical method to solve the heterogeneous elastic anisotropic
    wave equation with arbitrary high-order accuracy in space and time on unstructured
    tetrahedral meshes. Using the most general Hooke's tensor we derive the velocity-stress
    formulation leading to a linear hyperbolic system which accounts for the variation
    of the material properties depending on direction. This approach allows for the
    accurate modelling even of the most general crystalline symmetry class, the triclinic
    anisotropy, as no interpolation of material properties to particular mesh vertices
    is necessary. The proposed method combines the Discontinuous Galerkin method with
    the arbitrary high-order derivatives (ADER) time integration approach using arbitrary
    high-order derivatives of the piecewise polynomial representation of the unknown
    solution. The discontinuities of this piecewise polynomial approximation at element
    interfaces permit the application of the well-established theory of finite volumes
    and numerical fluxes across element interfaces obtained by the solution of derivative
    Riemann problems. Due to the novel ADER time integration technique the scheme
    provides the same approximation order in space and time automatically. A numerical
    convergence study confirms that the new scheme achieves the desired arbitrary
    high-order accuracy even for anisotropic material on unstructured tetrahedral
    meshes. Furthermore, it shows that higher accuracy can be reached with higher-order
    schemes while reducing computational cost and storage space. To this end, we also
    present a new Godunov-type numerical flux for anisotropic material and compare
    its accuracy with a computationally simpler Rusanov flux. As a further extension,
    we include the coupling of anisotropy and viscoelastic attenuation based on the
    Generalized Maxwell Body rheology and the mean and deviatoric stress concepts.
    Finally, we validate the new scheme by comparing the results of our simulations
    to an analytic solution as well as to spectral element computations.

- abstract: We present a new numerical method to solve the heterogeneous anelastic,
    seismic wave equations with arbitrary high order accuracy in space and time on
    3-D unstructured tetrahedral meshes. Using the velocity--stress formulation provides
    a linear hyperbolic system of equations with source terms that is completed by
    additional equations for the anelastic functions including the strain history
    of the material. These additional equations result from the rheological model
    of the generalized Maxwell body and permit the incorporation of realistic attenuation
    properties of viscoelastic material accounting for the behaviour of elastic solids
    and viscous fluids. The proposed method combines the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG)
    finite element (FE) method with the ADER approach using Arbitrary high order DERivatives
    for flux calculations. The DG approach, in contrast to classical FE methods, uses
    a piecewise polynomial approximation of the numerical solution which allows for
    discontinuities at element interfaces. Therefore, the well-established theory
    of numerical fluxes across element interfaces obtained by the solution of Riemann
    problems can be applied as in the finite volume framework. The main idea of the
    ADER time integration approach is a Taylor expansion in time in which all time
    derivatives are replaced by space derivatives using the so-called Cauchy---Kovalewski
    procedure which makes extensive use of the governing PDE. Due to the ADER time
    integration technique the same approximation order in space and time is achieved
    automatically and the method is a one-step scheme advancing the solution for one
    time step without intermediate stages. To this end, we introduce a new unrolled
    recursive algorithm for efficiently computing the Cauchy--Kovalewski procedure
    by making use of the sparsity of the system matrices. The numerical convergence
    analysis demonstrates that the new schemes provide very high order accuracy even
    on unstructured tetrahedral meshes while computational cost and storage space
    for a desired accuracy can be reduced when applying higher degree approximation
    polynomials. In addition, we investigate the increase in computing time, when
    the number of relaxation mechanisms due to the generalized Maxwell body are increased.
    An application to a well-acknowledged test case and comparisons with analytic
    and reference solutions, obtained by different well-established numerical methods,
    confirm the performance of the proposed method. Therefore, the development of
    the highly accurate ADER---DG approach for tetrahedral meshes including viscoelastic
    material provides a novel, flexible and efficient numerical technique to approach
    3-D wave propagation problems including realistic attenuation and complex geometry.

- abstract: We present a new numerical method to solve the heterogeneous elastic wave
    equations formulated as a linear hyperbolic system using first-order derivatives
    with arbitrary high-order accuracy in space and time on 3-D unstructured tetrahedral
    meshes. The method combines the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) Finite Element (FE)
    method with the ADER approach using Arbitrary high-order DERivatives for flux
    calculation. In the DG framework, in contrast to classical FE methods, the numerical
    solution is approximated by piecewise polynomials which allow for discontinuities
    at element interfaces. Therefore, the well-established theory of numerical fluxes
    across element interfaces obtained by the solution of Riemann-Problems can be
    applied as in the finite volume framework. To define a suitable flux over the
    element surfaces, we solve so-called Generalized Riemann-Problems (GRP) at the
    element interfaces. The GRP solution provides simultaneously a numerical flux
    function as well as a time-integration method. The main idea is a Taylor expansion
    in time in which all time-derivatives are replaced by space derivatives using
    the so-called Cauchy--Kovalewski or Lax--Wendroff procedure which makes extensive
    use of the governing PDE. The numerical solution can thus be advanced for one
    time step without intermediate stages as typical, for example, for classical Runge--Kutta
    time stepping schemes. Due to the ADER time-integration technique, the same approximation
    order in space and time is achieved automatically. Furthermore, the projection
    of the tetrahedral elements in physical space on to a canonical reference tetrahedron
    allows for an efficient implementation, as many computations of 3-D integrals
    can be carried out analytically beforehand. Based on a numerical convergence analysis,
    we demonstrate that the new schemes provide very high order accuracy even on unstructured
    tetrahedral meshes and computational cost and storage space for a desired accuracy
    can be reduced by higher-order schemes. Moreover, due to the choice of the basis
    functions for the piecewise polynomial approximation, the new ADER--DG method
    shows spectral convergence on tetrahedral meshes. An application of the new method
    to a well-acknowledged test case and comparisons with analytical and reference
    solutions, obtained by different well-established methods, confirm the performance
    of the proposed method. Therefore, the development of the highly accurate ADER--DG
    approach for tetrahedral meshes provides a numerical technique to approach 3-D
    wave propagation problems in complex geometry with unforeseen accuracy.

- abstract: We present a new numerical approach to solve the elastic wave equation
    in heterogeneous media in the presence of externally given source terms with arbitrary
    high-order accuracy in space and time on unstructured triangular meshes. We combine
    a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with the ideas of the ADER time integration
    approach using Arbitrary high-order DERivatives. The time integration is performed
    via the so-called Cauchy-Kovalewski procedure using repeatedly the governing partial
    differential equation itself. In contrast to classical finite element methods
    we allow for discontinuities of the piecewise polynomial approximation of the
    solution at element interfaces. This way, we can use the well-established theory
    of fluxes across element interfaces based on the solution of Riemann problems
    as developed in the finite volume framework. In particular, we replace time derivatives
    in the Taylor expansion of the time integration procedure by space derivatives
    to obtain a numerical scheme of the same high order in space and time using only
    one single explicit step to evolve the solution from one time level to another.
    The method is specially suited for linear hyperbolic systems such as the heterogeneous
    elastic wave equations and allows an efficient implementation. We consider continuous
    sources in space and time and point sources characterized by a Delta distribution
    in space and some continuous source time function. Hereby, the method is able
    to deal with point sources at any position in the computational domain that does
    not necessarily need to coincide with a mesh point. Interpolation is automatically
    performed by evaluation of test functions at the source locations. The convergence
    analysis demonstrates that very high accuracy is retained even on strongly irregular
    meshes and by increasing the order of the ADER--DG schemes computational time
    and storage space can be reduced remarkably. Applications of the proposed method
    to Lamb's Problem, a problem of strong material heterogeneities and to an example
    of global seismic wave propagation finally confirm its accuracy, robustness and
    high flexibility.
