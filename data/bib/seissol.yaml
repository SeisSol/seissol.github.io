- abstract: "We present a dynamic rupture model of the 2016 Mw 7.8 Kaik\u014Dura earthquake\
    \ to unravel the event's riddles in a physics-based manner and provide insight\
    \ on the mechanical viability of competing hypotheses proposed to explain them.\
    \ Our model reproduces key characteristics of the event and constraints puzzling\
    \ features inferred from high-quality observations including a large gap separating\
    \ surface rupture traces, the possibility of significant slip on the subduction\
    \ interface, the non-rupture of the Hope fault, and slow apparent rupture speed.\
    \ We show that the observed rupture cascade is dynamically consistent with regional\
    \ stress estimates and a crustal fault network geometry inferred from seismic\
    \ and geodetic data. We propose that the complex fault system operates at low\
    \ apparent friction thanks to the combined effects of overpressurized fluids,\
    \ low dynamic friction and stress concentrations induced by deep fault creep."

- abstract: "The dynamics and potential size of earthquakes depend crucially on rupture\
    \ transfers between adjacent fault segments. To accurately describe earthquake\
    \ source dynamics, numerical models can account for realistic fault geometries\
    \ and rheologies such as nonlinear inelastic processes off the slip interface.\
    \ We present implementation, verification and application of off-fault Drucker--Prager\
    \ plasticity in the open source software SeisSol (www.seissol.org). SeisSol is\
    \ based on an arbitrary high-order derivative modal Discontinuous Galerkin method\
    \ using unstructured, tetrahedral meshes specifically suited for complex geometries.\
    \ Two implementation approaches are detailed, modelling plastic failure either\
    \ employing subelemental quadrature points or switching to nodal basis coefficients.\
    \ At fine fault discretizations, the nodal basis approach is up to six\_times\
    \ more efficient in terms of computational costs while yielding comparable accuracy.\
    \ Both methods are verified in community benchmark problems and by 3-D numerical\
    \ h- and p-refinement studies with heterogeneous initial stresses. We observe\
    \ no spectral convergence for on-fault quantities with respect to a given reference\
    \ solution, but rather discuss a limitation to low-order convergence for heterogeneous\
    \ 3-D dynamic rupture problems. For simulations including plasticity, a high fault\
    \ resolution may be less crucial than commonly assumed, due to the regularization\
    \ of peak slip rate and an increase of the minimum cohesive zone width. In large-scale\
    \ dynamic rupture simulations based on the 1992 Landers earthquake, we observe\
    \ high rupture complexity including reverse slip, direct branching and dynamic\
    \ triggering. The spatiotemporal distribution of rupture transfers are altered\
    \ distinctively by plastic energy absorption, correlated with locations of geometrical\
    \ fault complexity. Computational cost increases by 7\u2009per\u2009cent when\
    \ accounting for off-fault plasticity in the demonstrating application. Our results\
    \ imply that the combination of fully 3-D dynamic modelling, complex fault geometries\
    \ and off-fault plastic yielding is important to realistically capture dynamic\
    \ rupture transfers in natural fault systems."

- abstract: Abstract:Function-on-scalar regression models feature a function over
    some domain as the response while the regressors are scalars. Collections of time
    series as well as 2D or 3D images can be considered as functional responses. We
    provide a hands-on introduction for a flexible semiparametric approach for function-on-scalar
    regression, using spatially referenced time series of ground velocity measurements
    from large-scale simulated earthquake data as a running example. We discuss important
    practical considerations and challenges in the modelling process and outline best
    practices. The outline of our approach is complemented by comprehensive R code,
    freely available in the online appendix. This text is aimed at analysts with a
    working knowledge of generalized regression models and penalized splines.

- abstract: We present a high-resolution simulation of the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake,
    including non-linear frictional failure on a megathrustsplay fault system. Our
    method exploits unstructured meshes capturing the complicated geometries in subduction
    zones that are crucial to understand large earthquakes and tsunami generation.
    These up-to-date largest and longest dynamic rupture simulations enable analysis
    of dynamic source effects on the seafloor displacements.To tackle the extreme
    size of this scenario an end-to-end optimization of the simulation code SeisSol
    was necessary. We implemented a new cache-aware wave propagation scheme and optimized
    the dynamic rupture kernels using code generation. We established a novel clustered
    local-time-stepping scheme for dynamic rupture. In total, we achieved a speed-up
    of 13.6 compared to the previous implementation. For the Sumatra scenario with
    221 million elements this reduced the time-to-solution to 13.9 hours on 86, 016
    Haswell cores. Furthermore, we used asynchronous output to overlap I/O and compute
    time.
