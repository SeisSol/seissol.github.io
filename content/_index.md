# THIS SITE IS WIP. GOTO [SEISSOL.ORG](http://www.seissol.org).

**Computational earthquake dynamics** is emerging as a key component in
**physics-based approaches** to strong motion prediction for seismic hazard assessment
and in physically constrained inversion approaches to earthquake source imaging from
seismological and geodetic observations.
Typical applications in both areas require the ability to deal with **rupture surfaces of
complicated, realistic geometries** with high computational efficiency.
In our implementation, **tetrahedral elements** are used which allows for a better fit of the
geometrical constraints of the problem, i.e., the fault shape, and for an easy control
of the **variation of element sizes** using smooth refining and coarsening strategies.
SeisSol is a software package for simulating wave propagation and dynamic rupture based
on the arbitrary high-order accurate derivative discontinuous Galerkin method (ADER-DG).

Characteristics of the SeisSol simulation software are:

- use of **tetrahedral** meshes to approximate complex 3D model geometries and rapid model generation
- use of **elastic, viscoelastic and viscoplastic** material to approximate realistic geological subsurface properties.
- use of **arbitrarily high approximation order in time and space** to produce reliable and sufficiently accurate synthetic seismograms or other seismological data sets.
