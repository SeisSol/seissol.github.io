As part of the ChEESE project, we realised a Pilot Demonstrator for simulating tsunami-earthquake interaction. The respective paper on "3D Acoustic-Elastic Coupling with Gravity: The Dynamics of the 2018 Palu, Sulawesi Earthquake and Tsunami" (L. Krenz et al.) has been accepted for the SC21 Supercomputing Conference.
