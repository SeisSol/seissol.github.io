At the [SC22 Supercomputing Conference](https://sc22.supercomputing.org/), the [Student Cluster Competition](https://www.studentclustercompetition.us/) has revealed SeisSol as its "Mystery Application". In 2022, 13 student teams again take part in a 48-hour live contest to compute HPC workloads on their compute clusters. While participants could prepare for most of the SCC applications over the summer, the Mystery Application is only revealed when the cluster competition has started. 

We're proud to introduce SeisSol as this year's Mystery Application. Lukas Krenz lead the efforts to prepare three use cases for the competition: evaluating the GFLOPS performance of the teams' compute clusters using the SeisSol proxy, and performing two fully-fledged earthquake simulations, modelling the 1994 Northridge Earthquake and the 2018 Palu, Sulawesi event. See our training material on [seissol.readthedocs.io](https://seissol.readthedocs.io/), if you want to give it a try yourself - but note that the SCC scenarios are substantially bigger!
