The SeisSol group at Scripps Institute, San Diego, reports about ["The complex dynamics of the 2023 Kahramanmaraş, Turkey, Mw 7.8-7.7 earthquake doublet"](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adi0685) in a [research article in Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi0685).

The pair of major earthquakes in Turkey, 2023, ended up as one of the deadliest disasters in the region in historic times. 
The earthquake sequence was unusual because the two earthquakes 
were almost of the same size (called a “doublet”), which compounded the damage. The earthquakes occurred on known faults,
and in this sense were expected. What was unexpected was their size: they were much bigger than any known past earthquakes
on the same faults. This happened because of an unlikely “cascade” that broke through various fault bends and step-overs 
that normally would act as barriers stopping the rupture propagation. There are strong similarities between the fault system that 
ruptured in Turkey and others such as in California.

The recent Magnitude 7.8 and 7.7 Turkey earthquakes, occurring only 9 hours apart in Feb 2023, results in a large amount of damage and casualties. While conventional earthquake studies and responses usually focus on particular data and aspects of earthquakes, our study provides a holistic synthesis of diverse and rich data sets and state-of-the-art earthquake interpretation tools. We find both earthquakes branched and jumped in unexpected ways, in which stress interactions, and static and dynamic triggering worked together across a complex fault system, resulting in a cascade of rupture with a larger than usual total rupture length and greater destruction potential than conventional fault segmentation model would have predicted. The unusually complex dynamics during and between the events of the Kahramanmaraş earthquake call for reassessment of common assumptions built into seismic hazard assessments.
