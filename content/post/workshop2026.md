In celebration of **20 years of SeisSol and 10 years of ExaHyPE**, we are happy to announce
* The first Joint SeisSol+ExaHyPE User Workshop,
* A combined SeisSol+ExaHyPE user training
* The first SeisSol+ExaHyPE Hackathon, 

taking place on June 11–12, 2026 in Garching (Munich), in the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ).

For the **user workshop (Jun 11)**, we call for contributed talks on usage and development of SeisSol or ExaHyPE, and closely related topics. 

The **user training and hackathon (Jun 12)** is supported by the projects [Geo-INQUIRE](https://www.geo-inquire.eu/) and [ChEESE-2P](https://cheese2.eu/) and addresses new/potential and existing users of SeisSol and ExaHyPE. We will offer (partly parallel) tracks on: 
* solving hyperbolic PDE systems with high-order discontinuous Galerkin methods using SeisSol and ExaHyPE
* Earthquake simulation with SeisSol
* ExaHyPE use cases from seismology to relativistic astrophysics
* Performing seismic simulations with SeisSol (hands-on session)
* How to implement your own hyperbolic PDE solver in ExaHyPE (hands-on session)

Existing and more experienced users of SeisSol and ExaHyPE are invited to discuss issues of usage, optimisation and further development of SeisSol and ExaHyPE during our Hackathon session on Jun 12. 

**Registration:** Please refer to the [registration link](https://events.hifis.net/event/3608/) for further info and registration.

We hope you can join us.

Best regards,

Michael Bader, Tobias Weinzierl and Alice Gabriel
