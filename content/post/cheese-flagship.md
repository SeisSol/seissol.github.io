Since November 2018, SeisSol is one of [10 flagship codes](https://cheese-coe.eu/results/flagship-codes) of [ChEESE](https://cheese-coe.eu/), the new European Center of Excellence (CoE) in the domain of Solid Earth (SE). ChEESE targets the preparation of 10 Community flagship European codes for the upcoming pre-Exascale (2020) and Exascale (2022) supercomputers. 

SeisSol will be involved in the preparation of two [Pilot Demonstrators](https://cheese-coe.eu/results/pilots) in ChEESE: [Physics-based tsunami-earthquake interaction]( https://cheese-coe.eu/pilot/pd4-physics-based-tsunami-earthquake-interaction) and [Physics-Based Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment (PSHA)](https://cheese-coe.eu/pilot/pd5-physics-based-probabilistic-seismic-hazard-assessment-psha).
